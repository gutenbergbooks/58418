  <h2 class='c005'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The letters contained in this volume cover a large
and important period in Cicero’s life and in the
history of Rome. They begin when he was 38 years
of age; and at first they are not very numerous. There
are only two of that year (68 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>), six of the following
year, one of the year 66, when he held the praetorship,
and two of 65. Then there is a gap in his correspondence.
No letters at all survive from the period
of his consulship and the Catilinarian conspiracy;
and the letters to Atticus do not begin again until
two years after that event. Thereafter they are
sufficiently frequent to justify Cornelius Nepos’ criticism,
that reading them, one has little need of an
elaborate history of the period. There are full—almost
too full—details, considering the frequent
complaints and repetitions, during the year of his
banishment (58–57 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>), and the correspondence
continues unbroken to the year 54. Then after a
lapse of two years or more, which Atticus presumably
spent in Rome, it begins again in 51, when
Cicero was sent to Cilicia as pro-consul, much against
his will; and the volume ends with a hint of the
trouble that was brewing between Caesar and
Pompey, as Cicero was returning to Rome towards
the end of the next year.</p>

<p class='c007'>The letters have been translated in the traditionary
order in which they are usually printed. That order,
however, is not strictly chronological; and, for the
convenience of those who would read them in their
historical order, a table arranging them so far as
possible in order of date has been drawn up at the
end of the volume.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the basis of the text the Teubner edition has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>been used; but it has been revised by comparison with
more recent works and papers on the subject. Textual
notes have only been given in a few cases where the
reading is especially corrupt or uncertain; and other
notes too have been confined to cases where they seemed
absolutely indispensable. For such notes and in the
translation itself, I must acknowledge my indebtedness
to predecessors, especially to Tyrrell’s indispensable
edition and Shuckburgh’s excellent translation.</p>

<p class='c007'>There remain two small points to which I may
perhaps call attention here in case they should puzzle
the general reader. The first is that, when he
finds the dates in this volume disagreeing with the
rules and tables generally given in Latin grammars
and taught in schools, he must please to remember
that those rules apply only to the Julian Calendar,
which was introduced in 45 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, and that these
letters were written before that date. Before the
alterations introduced by Caesar, March, May, July
and October had 31 days each, February 28, and the
other months 29. Compared with the Julian Calendar
this shows a difference of two days in all dates which fall
between the Ides and the end of the months January,
August and December, and of one day in similar
dates in April, June, September and November.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second point, which requires explanation, is
the presence of some numerals in the margin of the
text of letters 16 to 19 of Book IV. As Mommsen
pointed out, the archetype from which the existent
MSS. were copied must have had some of the leaves
containing these letters transposed. These were
copied in our MSS. in the wrong order, and were so
printed in earlier editions. In the text Mommsen’s
order, with some recent modifications introduced by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>Holzapfel, has been adopted; and the figures in the
margin denote the place of the transposed passages in
the older editions, the Roman figures denoting the letter
from which each particular passage has been shifted
and the Arabic numerals the section of that letter.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following signs have been used in the apparatus
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">criticus</span>:—</p>

<p class='c008'><em>M</em> = the <cite>Codex Mediceus</cite> 49, 18, written in the year
1389 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>, and now preserved in the Laurentian
Library at Florence. <em>M</em><sup>1</sup> denotes the reading of
the first hand, and <em>M</em><sup>2</sup> that of a reviser.</p>

<p class='c008'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Δ</span> = the reading of <em>M</em> when supported by that of the
<cite>Codex Urbinas</cite> 322, a MS. of the 15th century,
preserved in the Vatican Library.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>E</em> = <cite>Codex Ambrosianus</cite> <span class='fss'>E</span>, 14, a MS. probably of the
14th century, in the Ambrosian Library at Milan.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>N</em> = the <cite>Codex ex abbatia Florentina</cite> n. 49 in the
Laurentian Library, written in the 14th or 15th
century.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>P</em> = No. 8536 of the Latin MSS. in the Bibliothèque
Nationale at Paris, a MS. of the 15th century.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>R</em> = No. 8538 of the same collection, written in the
year 1419. These four MSS. <em>E</em>, <em>N</em>, <em>P</em>, <em>R</em>, with
some others form a separate class; and</p>

<p class='c008'><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Σ</span> = the reading of all the MSS. of this class, or of a
preponderant number of them.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>C</em> = the marginal readings in Cratander’s edition of
1528, drawn from a MS. which is now lost.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>Z</em> = the readings of the lost <cite>Codex Tornaesianus</cite>, <em>Z</em><sup>b</sup>
denoting the reading as preserved by Bosius, and
<em>Z</em><sup>l</sup> that testified to by Lambinus.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>I</em> = the reading of the <cite>editio Jensoniana</cite> published at
Venice in 1470.</p>

<p class='c008'><cite>Rom.</cite> = the edition published at Rome in 1470.</p>

<p class='c007'>With regard to my candidature, in which I know
you take the greatest interest, things stand as follows,
so far as one can guess at present. P. Galba
is the only canvasser who is hard at work; and he
meets with a plain and simple, old-fashioned, No.
As people think, this unseemly haste of his in canvassing
is by no means a bad thing for my interests:
for most refusals imply a pledge of support to me.
So I have hope that I may derive some advantage
from it, when the news gets abroad that my
supporters are in the majority. I had thought of
beginning to canvass in the Campus Martius at the
election of tribunes on the 17th of July, the very
time that, Cincius tells me, your man will be starting
with this letter. It seems certain that Galba, Antonius,
and Q. Cornificius will be standing with me.
I can imagine your smile or sigh at the news. To
make you tear your hair, there are some who think
Caesonius will be a candidate too. I don’t suppose
Aquilius will. He has said not, pleading his illness
and his supremacy in the law courts in excuse.
Catiline will be sure to be standing, if the verdict is,
No sun at midday. Of course you will know all about
Aufidius and Palicanus, without waiting for letters
from me. Of those who are standing, Caesar is
thought to be a certainty: the real fight is expected</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>to lie between Thermus and Silanus. But they are
so unpopular and so unknown, that it seems to me to
be on the cards to smuggle in Curius. Nobody else
thinks so, however. It would probably suit our
book best for Thermus to get in with Caesar: for, of
the present batch of candidates, he would be the
most formidable rival if he were put off to my year,
as he is commissioner for the repairing of the Flaminian
road. That will easily be finished by then:
so I should like to lump him together with Caesar
now. Such is the present rough guess of the
chances of the candidates. I shall take the greatest
care to fulfil all a candidate’s duties: and, as Gaul’s
vote counts high, I shall probably get a free pass
and take a run up to visit Piso, as soon as things
have quieted down in the law courts here, returning
in January. When I have discovered the views of the
upper ten, I will let you know. The rest I hope will
be plain sailing, with my civilian rivals at any rate.
For our friend Pompey’s followers you must be responsible,
as you are quite close to them. Tell him
I shall not take it unkindly if he does not come to
my election. So much for that.</p>

<p class='c007'>But there is a thing for which I have to crave
your pardon. Your uncle, Caecilius, was cheated
out of a large sum of money by P. Varius, and has
taken an action against his brother, A. Caninius
Satyrus, about some property which he says was
fraudulently made over to him by Varius. The other
creditors have made common cause with him: and
among them are L. Lucullus and P. Scipio and the
man who was expected to act for them at the sale,
if the goods were put up for auction, L. Pontius.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pontius. Verum hoc ridiculum est de magistro. Nunc
cognosce rem. Rogavit me Caecilius, ut adessem
contra Satyrum. Dies fere nullus est, quin hic Satyrus
domum meam ventitet; observat L. Domitium
maxime, me habet proximum; fuit et mihi et Quinto
fratri magno usui in nostri petitionibus. Sane sum
perturbatus cum ipsius Satyri familiaritate tum Domiti,
in quo uno maxime ambitio nostra nititur. Demonstravi
haec Caecilio simul et illud ostendi, si ipse
unus cum illo uno contenderet, me ei satis facturum
fuisse; nunc in causa universorum creditorum, hominum
praesertim amplissimorum, qui sine eo, quem
Caecilius suo nomine perhiberet, facile causam communem
sustinerent, aequum esse eum et officio meo

<div class='english-page'>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>But it is absurd to talk of acting for them at present.
Now for the point. Caecilius asked me to take a
brief against Satyrus. Now there is hardly a day
but Satyrus pays me a visit. He is most attentive
to L. Domitius and after him to me, and he was of
great assistance to me and to my brother Quintus
when we were canvassing. I am really embarrassed
on account of the friendliness of Satyrus himself and
of Domitius, who is the mainstay of my hopes. I
pointed this out to Caecilius, assuring him at the
same time that, if he stood alone against Satyrus,
I would have done my best for him: but, as
things were, when the creditors had combined and
were such influential persons that they would easily
win their case without any special advocate whom
Caecilius might retain on his own account, it was only
fair for him to consider my obligations and my circumstances.
He seemed to take it more ungraciously
than I could have wished or than a gentleman
should: and afterwards he withdrew entirely from the
intimacy which had grown up between us in the last
few days.</p>

<p class='c007'>Please try to forgive me and to believe that delicacy
prevented me from appearing against a friend whose
very good name was at stake, in the hour of his misfortune,
when the friendly attentions he had paid to
me had been unfailing. If you cannot take so kind
a view, pray consider that my candidature stood in
the way. I think even so I may be forgiven: for
there is not “a trifle, some eightpenny matter,”<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c012'><sup>[2]</sup></a> at

I have had from him since, I trust things are as they
should be and as we wish them to be.</p>

<p class='c007'>You have no reason to complain of lack of letters
from me, as Pomponia has never let me know when
there was a messenger to give them to. Besides it
has so happened that I have not had anyone starting
for Epirus and have not yet heard of your arrival at
Athens. Acutilius’ business I settled according to
your directions, as soon as ever I got to Rome after
your departure: but, as it happened, there was
no hurry, and, knowing I could trust your good
judgement, I preferred Peducaeus to advise you
by letter rather than myself. It was not the bother
of writing you an account of his grievances that I
shirked. I spent several days listening to him, and
you know his way of talking; and I did not mind,
though it was a bit of a bore. Though you grumble
at me, I’ve only had one letter from you, let me tell
you, and you have had more time to write and a
better chance of sending letters than I’ve had.</p>

<p class='c007'>All’s well—as well as could be desired—at home.
Quintus and I are looking after your mother and
sister. I’ve spoken to Acutilius. He says his broker
has not advised him, and is much surprised
there should have been such a fuss because he
refused to guarantee that there should be no further
claims on you.  The settlement that you have
arranged about Tadius’ affairs is, I am sure, very
good news for him, and he is pleased about it. That
friend of mine, who is really quite a good soul and
very amiable to me, is exceedingly annoyed with
you. When I know how deeply you take it to heart,
I may be able to lay my plans accordingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have raised the £180<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c012'><sup>[8]</sup></a> for L. Cincius for the

figures of Hermes in Pentelic marble with bronze
heads, about which you wrote, I have already fallen
in love with: so please send them and anything else
that you think suits the place, and my enthusiasm
for such things, and your own taste—the more the
merrier, and the sooner the better—especially those
you intend for the Gymnasium and the colonnade.
For my appreciation for art treasures is so great that
I am afraid most people will laugh at me, though I
expect encouragement from you. If none of Lentulus’
boats are coming, put them on any ship you like.
My little darling, Tullia, keeps asking for your
promised present and duns me as though I were
answerable for you. But I am going to deny my
obligation rather than pay up.</p>

my best to replace you on your old friendly footing
with Lucceius. But when I had done the uttermost,
I failed not only to win back his old affection
for you, but even to extract from him the
reason for his change of feelings towards you.
Though he is continually harping on that arbitration
case of his, and the other things which I noticed
provoked him when you were here, there is something
else, I am sure, which is rankling in his
mind. And this your presence, a talk with him,
and still more the sight of your familiar face,
would do more to remove than either your letters

Under my circumstances I couldn’t honourably
champion him. I should lose the respect of
both parties if I did: and what’s more, I wouldn’t,
if I could, in view of certain things that have happened,
to which I should like to call your attention.
There’s a freedman of mine, an utter scoundrel—Hilarus
I mean—an accountant and a client of yours.
Valerius the interpreter sends me news of him, and
Thyillus says he has heard too that the fellow is
with Antony, and that Antony, when he is making
requisitions, always asserts that part is levied on
my authority, and that I have sent a freedman to
look after my share. I am considerably annoyed,
though I hardly believe the story: but there has
been a good deal of talk. Look into the matter
thoroughly and try to get to the bottom of it, and,
if you possibly can, get that rascal shifted. Valerius
mentioned Cn. Plancius as his authority for the
statement. I leave the whole matter entirely in
your hands to investigate.</p>

<p class='c007'>I am assured that Pompey is on the best of terms
with me. Mucia’s divorce meets with every one’s
approval. I expect you have heard that P. Clodius,
son of Appius, was discovered in woman’s clothes in
C. Caesar’s house, where the sacrifice was going on:
but a servant girl managed to smuggle him out.
It has created a public scandal: and I am sure you
will be sorry to hear of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>I don’t think I have any other news for you: and
I’m sorry to say I’ve been rather upset while writing.

to whom you gave it, I think at the Three
Taverns; another brought by your host at Canusium;
and a third which you say you posted from the boat just
as you got under weigh. All three of them were, as
a pupil in the rhetorical schools would say, at once
sprinkled with the salt of refinement and stamped
with the brand of affection. They certainly provoke an
answer: but I have been rather slow about sending
one, for lack of a safe messenger. There are very
few who can carry a letter of weight without lightening
it by a perusal. Besides, I don’t hear of every
traveller to Epirus. For I suppose, when you have
offered sacrifice at your villa Amalthea, you will start
at once to lay siege to Sicyon. I’m not certain

murmured disapproval. It has freed me from the necessity
of bowing to a crotchety individual, and sets
me at liberty to preserve my political dignity in spite
of him. The second place carries nearly as much weight
with it as the first, and one’s actions are not so much
bound by obligation to the consul. The third place
fell to Catulus: the fourth, if you want to go as far, to
Hortensius. The consul is petty-minded and perverse,
a quibbler who used that bitter kind of sarcasm, which
raises a laugh even when there is no wit in the words,
on the strength of his expression rather than his expressions.
He is no politician at all, he stands aloof
from the conservatives: and one cannot expect him to
render any good services to the state, because he
does not wish to do so, nor any bad, because he does
not dare. But his colleague is most polite to me, a
keen politician and a bulwark of the conservative
party. There is a slight difference of opinion between
them at present: but I am afraid that the
contagion may spread. No doubt you have heard
that, when the sacrifice was taking place in Caesar’s
house, a man in woman’s clothes got in; and that
after the Vestal Virgins had performed the sacrifice
afresh, the matter was mentioned in the House by
Cornificius. Note that he was the prime mover and
none of us. Then a resolution was passed, the
matter was referred to the Virgins and the priests,
and they pronounced it a sacrilege. So the consuls
were directed by the House to bring in a bill about
it. Caesar has divorced his wife. Piso’s friendship</p>

he does not disguise it very well. He is totally

as well as in sense of honour, resolution and

and then use them as his panel. That of course
was the plan proposed by the Senate in Clodius’
trial for sacrilege. To this Pompey replied <em>en grand
seigneur</em> that he felt and always had felt the greatest
respect for the Senate’s authority; and very long-winded
he was about it. Afterwards the consul
Messalla asked Pompey in the Senate for his opinion
on the sacrilege and the proposed bill. He delivered
a speech eulogizing the Senate’s measures <em>en bloc</em>,
and said to me as he sat down at my side, that he
thought he had given a sufficiently clear answer to
“those questions.” Crassus no sooner saw that he
had won public appreciation, because people fancied
that he approved of my consulship, than up he got
and spoke of it in the most complimentary way.
He said that he owed his seat in the House,
his privileges as a citizen, his freedom and his very
life, to me. He never saw his wife’s face, or his
home, or his native land, without recognizing the
debt he owed to me. But enough. He worked up
with great effect all that purple patch which I so
often use here and there to adorn my speeches, to
which you play Aristarchus<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c012'><sup>[16]</sup></a>—the passage about fire

full of authority, and full of saving counsel. Our
friend Hortensius joined him too, and many other
loyalists, Favonius particularly distinguishing himself
for his energy. This rally of the conservatives broke
up the meeting, and the Senate was called together.
In a full house a resolution was passed that persuasion
should be used to induce the people to accept the
measure, though Piso opposed it and Clodius went
down on his knees to us one by one. Some fifteen
supported Curio’s rejection of the bill, while the
opposite party numbered easily 400. That settled
the matter. Funfius the tribune collapsed. Clodius
delivered some pitiful harangues, in which he hurled

Well! In my answer I’ll put the cart before the
horse like Homer. So long as I had to defend the
Senate’s decree, I fought so fiercely and doughtily,
that cheering crowds rallied round me enthusiastic
in my applause. You would certainly have marvelled
at my courage on this occasion, if ever you credited
me with any courage in my country’s defence. When
Clodius fell back on speechifying and took my name

Didn’t I rate the old men for their frivolity, the

not being blind to the impecuniosity of the jurymen.
I confined my testimony to points so thoroughly well-known
and attested that I could not omit them. So,
to come at last to the “horse,” if you want to know
the reason for his acquittal, it lay in the jury’s lack of
pence and of conscience. But it was Hortensius’
plan that made such a result possible. In his fright
that Fufius might veto the Senate’s measure, he
overlooked the fact that it would be better for Clodius
to be kept in disgrace with a trial hanging over
his head, than for the case to come before an unsound
court. Spurred on by hatred, he rushed the matter
into court, saying that a leaden sword was sharp
enough to cut Clodius’ throat.</p>

<p class='c007'>If you want to know about the trial, the result of
it was so incredible that now after the event everybody
agrees with my forebodings and blames Hortensius.
The challenging of the jury took place
amidst an uproar, since the prosecutor like a good
censor rejected all the knaves, and the defendant like
a kind-hearted trainer of gladiators set aside all the
respectable people. And as soon as the jury took
their seats, the patriotic party began to have grave
misgivings: for never did a more disreputable set of
people get together even in a gambling hell.

At the preliminary proceedings, as point after point
was put before the jury, their strict and unanimous
uprightness was extraordinary. The defendant never
won a point, and the prosecution were granted more
than they asked for. It goes without saying that
Hortensius was triumphant at his penetration; and no

one that had been condemned a thousand times over.</p>

<p class='c007'>You have no doubt heard how the jury rose in a body
to protect me, when I stepped into the witness-box
and Clodius’ supporters began to hoot: and how they
offered their throats to Clodius’ sword in defence of
me. Thereby, to my mind they paid me a far higher
compliment than your fellow-citizens paid Xenocrates,
when they refused to let him take the oath
before giving his testimony, or our Roman jury paid
Metellus Numidicus, when they would not look at
the accounts which he passed round as is usual in
such cases. I repeat, the honour shown me was far
greater. The shouts of the jury, proclaiming me as
the saviour of the country crushed and annihilated
the defendant and all his supporters. And on the
next day a crowd as great as that which conducted
me home at the end of my consulship gathered
round me. Our noble Areopagites declared they
would not come without a guard. The votes of the
court were taken, and there was only one person who
voted a guard unnecessary. The point was laid before
the Senate, who passed a decree in the strongest and
most complimentary terms, thanking the jury and
referring the matter to the magistrates. No one
thought Clodius would defend his case. “Tell me

there was! Even the favours of certain ladies and

to some of the jury to swell the bribe. All honest
men withdrew entirely from the case and the forum
was full of slaves. Yet five and twenty of the jury
were brave enough to risk their necks, preferring
death to treachery: but there were thirty-one who
were more influenced by famine than fame. Catulus

right and justice for filthy lucre, and when Hodge
and John a Nokes and Tom a Styles and all the riff-raff
of that description have declared a thing not to
have happened which every man—man did I say?—nay,
every beast of the field, knows for a fact. Still—to
give you some consolation about politics—the
country has not received so serious a blow as traitors
wished, nor is iniquity vaunting itself so rampantly
on its victory. For they clearly thought that, when
religious and moral scruples, judicial honour and the
Senate’s authority had been destroyed, iniquity and
lust would triumph openly, and would wreak their
vengeance on all honest folk for the brand that had
been stamped on vice by my consulship. I was the
man—I don’t think I am boasting unduly in saying
so to you privately, especially in a letter which I
would rather you didn’t read to anyone—I was the
man who revived the fainting courage of the patriots,
encouraging and cheering them one by one. I
attacked and routed that venal jury; and I did not
leave the victorious party and its supporters a word
to say for themselves. The consul Piso I did not leave
an inch to stand on. Syria, which had been promised
him as his province, I wrested from him. The Senate
I aroused from its despondency, recalling it to its
former uprightness. Clodius I bearded and crushed
in the Senate with a set speech full of dignity, and
then with a cross-examination, of which I will give
you a taste. The rest would lose both its verve and
its wit, when the fire of battle is out, and the tug-of-war,

Senate must not be crushed by a single blow, they
must not be faint-hearted. The wound is such that
it cannot be disguised, yet it must not be feared, lest
by our fear we prove ourselves abject cowards, or by
ignoring it, very fools. Lentulus twice obtained an
acquittal, and Catiline as often, and this is the third
criminal let loose on the country by a jury. But you
are mistaken, Clodius. The jury saved you for the
gallows, not for public life: their object was not to
keep you in the country, but to keep you from leaving
it. Keep up your hearts, then, senators, and preserve
your dignity. The feelings of all patriots are
unchanged; they have suffered grief, but their
courage is undiminished. It is no new disaster that
has befallen us, we have merely discovered one that
existed unnoticed. The trial of one villain has
revealed many as guilty as himself.” But there, I’ve
nearly copied the whole speech. Now for our passage
of arms. Up gets this pretty boy and reproaches
me with spending my time at Baiae. It was a lie:
and anyhow what did it matter? “One would think,”
said I, “you were accusing me of spending my time
in hiding.” “What need has a man of Arpinum to
take the waters?” asks Clodius: and I answered:
“You should talk like that to your patron<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c012'><sup>[24]</sup></a> who
wanted to take the waters of a man of Arpinum,”—you
know about the sea-water baths. “How long
are we going to let this man king it over us?” says
he. “I wonder you mention the word king,” I

decrees have been passed on the proposal of Cato
and Domitius, which are unpopular because they are
thought to be directed against the consul; one,
making it lawful to search the house of any magistrate,
and the other making it a treasonable offence
to have bribery agents in one’s house. The tribune
Lurco, who entered on his office under another
law,<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c012'><sup>[28]</sup></a> has been freed from the obligations of the
Aelian and Fufian laws, so that he may propose his
law about bribery. He had luck in publishing it in
spite of his deformity. Accordingly the elections
have been postponed till the 27th of July. The
new point about this law is that a mere promise to
bribe the tribesmen counts for nothing, if it is not
fulfilled; but, if it is fulfilled, the man who made it
is liable for life to a fine of £27<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c012'><sup>[29]</sup></a> per tribe. I remarked
Clodius had kept this law before it was passed:
for he is always promising and not paying. But, I
say, if he<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c012'><sup>[30]</sup></a> gets in, that consulship of mine which

my affection for both of you, and I wonder what
can have happened to cause my brother Quintus such
grave offence and to make him change his mind so
extraordinarily. I grasped some time ago, what I
think you were beginning to suspect, when you left,
that at the bottom of it must be some idea of an
insult, and that his feelings were wounded and some
unpleasant suspicions had taken deep root. Though
I often before sought to heal the wound, and redoubled
my efforts after the allotment of his province,
I could neither find that he was as much
annoyed as your letter makes out, nor yet make as
much headway with him as I wished. However, I
used to console myself with the thought that he
would be sure to see you either at Dyrrachium or
somewhere thereabout. And I had quite made up
my mind that when that occurred, all the difficulties
between you would be smoothed over as much by
the mere sight of one another and the pleasure of
meeting as by conversation and discussion. For I
need not tell you, who know it yourself, how amiable
and kindly my brother Quintus is, and how sensitive
he is and ready both to take offence and to forget
it. But it has happened most unfortunately that
you have not seen him anywhere. For the impression
he has received from some designing persons
has had more weight with him than either his duty
or your old intimacy and affection which ought to
have had the greatest weight of all. Where the
blame for this unpleasantness rests, it is easier for
me to imagine than to write. For I am afraid that
in defending my relatives I may not spare yours.
For my view is that, even if no wound was inflicted</p>

healed the one which existed. But the real fault of
the whole matter, which is of rather wider extent
than it appears, I can explain to you more conveniently
when we meet. As to the letter which he
sent to you from Thessalonica and the language which
you think he used about you both to your friends at
Rome and on his journey, I cannot see any sufficient
cause for them; but all my hope of removing this
unpleasantness lies in your kindness. For if you can
persuade yourself that the best of men are often
those whose feelings are easy to arouse and easy to
appease, and that this nimbleness, if I may use the
word, and sensitiveness of disposition are generally
signs of a good heart, and—what is the main point—that
we must put up with one another’s unpleasantnesses
and faults and insults, then, as I hope,
all this can be smoothed over easily. This I beg of
you to do. For, as I hold you in such peculiar
esteem, it is my dearest wish that there may not be
any of my people who either does not love you or is
not loved by you.</p>

<p class='c007'>That part of your letter in which you mention the
chances of preferment in the provinces or in town,
which you neglected in my consulship and at other
times, was most unnecessary, for I am thoroughly
persuaded of your disinterestedness and magnanimity,
and I have never thought that there was any difference
between you and me, except our choice of a
career. A touch of ambition led me to seek for distinction,
while another perfectly laudable motive led
you to honourable ease. But in the real glory which
consists in uprightness, industry and piety, there is
no one I place above you, not even myself, and as</p>

which have been so religiously preserved, will retain
their inviolability.</p>

<p class='c007'>The political position here is wretched, rotten and
unstable. I expect you have heard that our friends the
knights have almost had a rupture with the Senate.
The first point that seriously annoyed them was the
publication of a senatorial decree for an investigation
into any cases of bribery of jurymen. As I did not
happen to be present when the decree was passed,
and noticed that the knights were annoyed though
they did not openly say so, I remonstrated with the
Senate very impressively, I think, and spoke with
great weight and fluency, considering how shameless
the case was. Here is another intolerable piece of
petulance on the part of the knights! Yet I have not
only put up with it, but forwarded their cause. The
people who farmed the province of Asia from the
censors, complained in the Senate that their avariciousness
had led them to pay too high a price for it,
and requested to have the lease annulled. I was
their chief supporter, or rather the second, for it was
Crassus who encouraged them to venture on the
demand. It is a scandalous affair, a disgraceful request
and a confession of foolhardiness. There was
considerable danger, that, if they met with a refusal,
they might have severed their connection with the
Senate entirely. In this case too I was the main person
who came to the rescue, and obtained for them a
hearing in a very full and friendly House, and discoursed
freely on the dignity and harmony of the
two orders both on the first of December and the
following day. The matter is not yet settled: but
the Senate’s inclination is clear. For one person</p>

I thought I had a chance of using the surgeon’s
knife on licentiousness and curbing youthful excesses:
and I exerted myself, putting forth all the resources
of my intellect and mind, not out of private
spite, but in the hope of effecting a radical cure of
the State. The corruption of the jury by bribery and
debauchery dealt a crushing blow to the republic.
See what has followed. We have had a consul forced
on us, at whom no one except us philosophers can
look without a sigh. That is a fatal stroke. Though
a senatorial decree has been passed about the bribery
of juries, no law has been carried; the Senate has
been frightened out of it, and the knights have been
estranged. So this one year has overturned two
bulwarks of the State which had been erected by me
alone: for it has destroyed the prestige of the Senate
and broken up the harmony of the orders. Now
comes this precious year. It was inaugurated by
the suspension of the annual rites of the goddess of
youth: for Memmius initiated M. Lucullus’ wife into
some rites of his own. Menelaus took it hard and
divorced his wife. Unlike the shepherd of Ida, who
only slighted Menelaus, our modern Paris thought

member of the same tribe as yourself, and his father
Sextus used to distribute money to your tribesmen—he

even proposes that the whole people shall vote on
the matter in the Campus Martius. I gave him my</p>

phlegmatic of mortals. Metellus is an excellent
consul and an admirer of mine; but he has lessened
his influence by making, only for form’s sake, the
very same proposal about Clodius. But Aulus’ son—heavens
above! what a cowardly and spiritless
wretch for a soldier! Just fit to be exposed, as he
is, to the daily abuse of Palicanus. An agrarian law
has been proposed by Flavius,—a very paltry production,
almost identical with the Plotian law. And
in the meantime not the ghost of a real statesman
is to be found. The man who could be one, my intimate
friend—for so he is, I would have you to know—Pompey,
wraps that precious triumphal cloak of his
around him in silence. Crassus never utters a word
to risk his popularity. The others you know well
enough—fools who seem to hope that their fish-ponds
may be saved, though the country go to rack and
ruin. There is one who can be said to take some
pains, but, according to my view, with more constancy
and honesty than judgement and ability—Cato. It
is now three months that he has been worrying
those wretched tax-collectors, who used to be
great friends of his, and won’t let the Senate give
them an answer. So we are forced to suspend
all decrees on other subjects until the tax-collectors
have had an answer. And I suppose even the

cannot forbear adding here that when my lot came
up first in the ballot among the ex-consuls, the
Senate were unanimous in declaring that I should
be kept in Rome. The same happened to Pompey
after me, so that we two appear to be kept as
pledges of the State. Why should I look for the
“bravos” of strangers when these triumphs bloom
for me at home?</p>

<p class='c007'>Well, this is the state of affairs in the city. The
agrarian law was zealously pushed by the tribune
Flavius with the support of Pompey, though its only
claim to popularity was its supporter. My proposal
to remove from the law any points which encroached
on private rights was favourably received by a public
meeting. I proposed to exempt from its action such
land as was public in the consulship of P. Mucius and
L. Calpurnius,<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c012'><sup>[41]</sup></a> to confirm Sulla’s veterans in their
possessions, to allow the people of Volaterra and
Arretium to retain in their holding their land which
Sulla had made public land, but had not distributed:
the only clause I did not reject was that land should
be purchased by this wind-fall which will come in
from the new foreign revenues in the next five years.
The Senate was opposed to the whole agrarian
scheme, suspecting that Pompey was aiming at
getting some new powers. Pompey had set his
heart on carrying the law through. I on the other
hand, with the full approval of the applicants for
land, was for securing the holdings of all private</p>

consists in the rich landed gentry—while at the same
time I fulfilled my desire to satisfy Pompey and the
populace by supporting the purchase of land, thinking
that, if that were thoroughly carried out, the city
might be emptied of the dregs of the populace, and
the deserted parts of Italy peopled. But the matter
has cooled off now this war has interrupted it. Metellus
is an excellent consul and a great admirer of
mine. The other one is an utter nonentity and
clearly bought a pig in a poke when he got the consulship.
That is all my political news, unless you
think this has a bearing on politics. One Herennius,
a tribune and fellow tribesman of yours, and a man
of no character or position, has begun frequently
proposing the transference of P. Clodius from a
patrician to a plebeian; and his proposals are vetoed
by many of his colleagues. This, I think, is all the
public news.</p>

<p class='c007'>For myself, ever since that December day when I
won such splendid and immortal glory, though it
carried with it much envy and enmity, I have not
ceased to employ the same high-minded policy and to
keep the position I have won and taken up. But, as
soon as the acquittal of Clodius showed me the uncertainty
and instability of the law courts, and I saw
too how easily our friends the tax-gatherers could be
estranged from the Senate, though they might not
sever their connection with me, while the well-to-do—your
friends with the fish-ponds, I mean—took no
pains to disguise their envy of me, I bethought me
that I had better look out for some stronger support
and more secure protection. So firstly I brought Pompey,

my principles; indeed my whole conduct is regulated

in my private affairs the weakness of the loyal party,

Well, perhaps the course I took was not opposed to
my own advantage and peace of life, but I swear it
was far more to the advantage of the State than to
mine that I should be the means of suppressing the
attacks of the disloyal, and of strengthening the
wavering policy of a man of the highest position,
influence and popularity, and converting him from
pandering to the disloyal to approval of my achievements.
If I had had to make any sacrifice of principle
in so doing, I should never have thought it justifiable:
but I managed it so that he seemed to gain in principle
by his approval of me, more than I lost in bowing
to him. I will take care that my actions now
and in the future do not convey the impression that
what I did in the past was done at haphazard. My

to be placed in the Senate, as I wrote you before:
for there is no one now to raise a complaint. It
would be tedious to wait for them to move. Fight
the point in some other way, if you can. When the
law was passed, nobody noticed to whom it applied,
and the dummy members plumped eagerly in its
favour. The time has not yet come for rescinding
the decree, because there is no one who complains
about it, and some favour it, partly from spite and
partly from an idea of its justness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Your friend Metellus is an excellent consul: I
have only one fault to find with him, he is not at all
pleased with the news of peace from Gaul. I take
it he wants a triumph. I wish he would moderate
that desire: in every other way he is excellent. The
behaviour of Aulus’s son makes his consulship not a
consulship, but a blot on the scutcheon<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c012'><sup>[45]</sup></a> of our friend

<p class='c007'>I have sent you one of my works, a history of my

as they read mine, they somehow or other don’t hurry
themselves about it.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 1st of June I met your boy as I was on my
way to Antium and glad to get away from M. Metellus’s
gladiatorial exhibition. He delivered your
letter, and a memorial of my consulship written in
Greek. I felt very glad that I gave L. Cossinius the
book I had written in Greek on the same subject to
take to you some time ago. For, if I had read yours
first you would say that I had plagiarized from you.
Though yours (which I read with pleasure) seemed
to me a trifle rough and unadorned, yet its very lack
of ornament is an ornament in itself, just as women
were thought to have the best scent who used no
scent. My book, on the other hand, has exhausted
all the scent box of Isocrates, and all the rouge-pots
of his pupils, and some of Aristotle’s colours too.
You scanned it through, as you tell me in another
letter, at Corcyra, before you had received it from
Cossinius, I suppose. I should never have dared to
send it to you, if I had not revised it with leisure and
care. I sent the memoir to Posidonius too, asking
him to write something more elaborate on the same
subject; but he tells me that, far from being inspired
to write by the perusal of it, he was decidedly put
off. In fact, I have flabbergasted the whole Greek
nation: so I have ceased to be plagued by the people
who were always hanging about asking me to give
them something of mine to polish up. If you like the</p>

towns have it in stock; for I think it may add some
lustre to my achievements. I will send you the bits
of speeches you ask for and some more too, as you
find some interest in things which I write to satisfy
young admirers. Your fellow-citizen, Demosthenes,
gained a reputation by the speeches called the Philippics,
in which he departed from the quibbling style
of pleading we use in the law-courts, and appeared in
the role of a serious politician. So I took a fancy to
leave behind me also some speeches which may
be called consular. One was delivered in the House
on the 1st of January, another to the people on the
agrarian law, the third on Otho, the fourth for Rabirius,
the fifth for the sons of the proscribed, the sixth
when I declined a province in a public assembly, the
seventh when I drove Catiline out, the eighth before
the people the day after Catiline fled, the ninth in an
assembly on the day when the Allobroges gave their
information, the tenth in the House on the 5th of
December. There are two more short ones, mere
scraps of the agrarian law. I will see that you have
the whole <em>corpus</em>; and, since both my writing and my
achievements interest you, you will see from them
what I have done, and what I have written. Or else
you should not have asked for them: I was not the
one to obtrude them.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>so I have no chance of enjoying your society and
you lack mine. Just at present things are peaceful:
but if that little beauty<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c012'><sup>[47]</sup></a> should be strong enough to
indulge in any wilder freaks I should certainly be
routing you out of your retreat. However, Metellus
is holding him in nobly and will continue to do so.
Most assuredly he is a thoroughly patriotic consul,
and, as I always thought, an excellent fellow. Clodius
does not beat about the bush, he is quite plainly aiming
at the tribunate. When the point was discussed
in the Senate, I sat on him, accusing him of inconsistency,
for seeking the tribunate now in Rome,
when in Sicily he did nothing but repeat that what
he wanted was an inheritance. However, I added,
we need not put ourselves about on that point, as
he would not be allowed to ruin the country if he
becomes a plebeian any more than patricians of his
kidney were allowed to in my consulship. Then,
when he said he had come from the straits in a
week, so that no one could go to meet him, and had
entered the city at night, and boasted of the fact in
a public speech, I said there was nothing new in that.
“Seven days from Sicily to Rome: the other time
three hours from Rome to Interamna. He came in at
night: so he did before. No one met him now: nor
did anyone meet him last time, when they certainly
ought to have done so.” In fact, I am taking the
cheek out of him, not only by serious set speeches,
but by quips of this kind too. So nowadays I bandy
jests and banter with him quite familiarly. For instance,
when we were escorting a candidate, he asked
me whether I used to give the Sicilians seats at the
gladiatorial shows. I said, “No.” “Well,” said he,</p>

has such a lot of room, will not give me more than

room with your sister,” I answered. “You can always
lie with her.” You will say it was not the remark
for a consular to make. I confess it was not; but I
hate the woman, so unworthy of a consul. “For
she’s a shrew and wrangles with her mate,” and not
only with Metellus, but with Fabius too, because she
is annoyed at their interference in this affair.</p>

<p class='c007'>You ask about the agrarian law. Interest in
it seems to have cooled down. You give me a
gentle fillip for my familiarity with Pompey.
Please don’t imagine I have allied myself to him
solely to save my skin: the position of affairs is
such that, if we had had any disagreement, there
would of necessity have been great discord in the
State. Against that I have taken precautions and
made provision without wavering from my own
excellent policy, while making him more loyal
and less the people’s weathercock. He speaks, I
may tell you, far more glowingly about my achievements
than about his own, though many have tried
to set him against me, saying that he did his
duty to the country, but I saved it. What good his
statements will do me, I fail to see: but they will

make Caesar, who is now sailing gaily before the
breeze, a better patriot too, shall I be doing so poor
a service to the country? And, even if none were to
envy me and all supported me, as they ought, still a
remedy which cures the diseased parts of the State
should be preferable to one which amputates them.</p>

surely you must allow that I have done my best,

who have the power to do it. For our friend Cato is
not more to you than to me: but still with the best of

does harm to the country: for the opinions he delivers

Romulus.<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c012'><sup>[49]</sup></a> That a man who accepts a bribe for the

voted for it and won the House’s assent. Result, a
war of the knights with the Senate, but not with me.
I was against it. That the tax-collectors should repudiate
their bargain was a most shameless proceeding.
But we ought to have put up with the loss in order to
keep their good-will. Cato resisted and carried the
day. Result, though we’ve had a consul in prison, and
frequent riots, not a breath of encouragement from
one of those, who in my own consulship and that of my

of Nasica was nothing to be proud of; however
he conducted it very moderately. He spoke so

<p class='c007'>First a trifle please for good news.  Valerius has
been acquitted, with Hortensius as his advocate.
The verdict is generally thought to be a concession to
Aulus’ son; and I expect Iphicrates<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c012'><sup>[54]</sup></a> has been up to
some tricks, as you suggest. I didn’t like the look

let me tell you, you are finding fault with the
Education of Cyrus<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c012'><sup>[55]</sup></a>: for, when I made the same
remark to Cyrus, he said that the view of gardens was
not so pleasant, if the windows were broad. For, let <em>a</em>
be the point of vision, and <em>b, c</em> the object, and <em>d, e</em> the
rays,—you see what follows. If our sight resulted from
the impact of images,<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c012'><sup>[56]</sup></a> the images would be horribly
squeezed in the narrow space: but, as it is, the emission
of rays goes on merrily. If you have any other faults
to find, you will find me ready with an answer, unless
they are such as can be put to rights without expense.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r54'>54</a>. Obviously a nickname for Pompey, and, in view of the

and I shall follow the fashion of the Socratic schools
in giving both sides of the question, ending, however,
as they do, with the one which I prefer. It really is a
point that requires much consideration. For either I
have got to resist the agrarian measure strongly, which
would mean something of a fight, though I should gain
prestige by it; or I must hold my peace, which is equivalent
to retiring to Solonium or Antium; or else I must
assist the measure, and that is what they say Caesar
expects me to do beyond a doubt. For Cornelius paid
me a visit—I mean Balbus, Caesar’s great friend. He
assured me that Caesar will take my own and Pompey’s
opinion on everything, and that he will make an effort
to reconcile Pompey and Crassus. On this side of the
sheet may be placed an intimate connection with Pompey
and, if I like, with Caesar too, reconciliation with
my enemies, peace with the populace, and ease in my
old age. But my blood is still stirred by the <em>finale</em> I
laid down for myself in the 3rd book of my poem:<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c012'><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

a jolly good lot at Antium, or else count the
waves: the rough weather won’t allow me to catch
shads.  At writing my soul rebels utterly.  The
geographical work I had planned is a big undertaking.
Eratosthenes, whom I had taken as my
authority, is severely criticized by Serapion and
Hipparchus; and, if I take Tyrannio’s views too,
there is no telling what the result would be. Besides
the subject is confoundedly hard to explain and
monotonous, nor does it give one as many opportunities

generation and made a home for yourself at Buthrotum:
but you may take my word for it that this
township of Antium runs your borough very close.
To think of there being a place so near Rome, where
there are lots of people who have never seen Vatinius,
where there is not a single soul save myself
who cares whether any of our new commissioners are
alive or dead, where no one intrudes upon me, though
every one is fond of me. This, this is the very place for
me to play the politician: for there in Rome, besides
being shut out of politics, I am sick of them. So I
will compose a private memoir, which I will read only
to you, in the style of Theopompus, or even a still
bitterer vein. My only policy now is hatred of the
radicals: and that without rancour, indeed with some
pleasure in expressing it.</p>

<p class='c007'>But to return to business, I have written to the

I assure you, through any desire to postpone his
impeachment—for I am extraordinarily anxious to
conduct the case—but because I thought that he
would lose any popularity he had gained by turning
plebeian. “Why did you transfer yourself to the
plebs? Was it to pay a visit to Tigranes? Pray tell
me: don’t the kings of Armenia return the visit of a
patrician?” As you see, I had sharpened my wits
up to rally him on the subject of his embassy. But
if he rejects it with scorn, and, as you say, thereby
rouses the indignation of the proposers and augurs

<p class='c007'>When I was looking forward eagerly to a letter of
yours towards evening, as usual, lo and behold a
message that some slaves had come from Rome. I
called them, and inquired if they had any letters.
“No,” they said. “What’s that,” said I, “nothing
from Pomponius?” Frightened to death by my
voice and look they confessed they had been given
one, but it had been lost on the way. As you may
suppose, I was wild with annoyance. For every letter
you have sent me these last few days has contained
something of importance or entertainment. So, if
there was anything worth saying in the letter of the
15th of April, write at once and let me know it: if
there was nothing but nonsense, you owe me a repetition
of it.</p>

will learn what a pretty return he has made
for all my choicest panegyrics: and you may expect

see, if that good-for-nothing is in favour with our
sovereigns, he will have to give up crowing over the
“ex-consul with a cynic’s tongue” and those “Tritons
of the fish-ponds” together: for there will be
nothing to envy me for, when I have been robbed
of my power and my influence in the Senate. If on
the other hand he quarrels with them, then any
attack on me would be absurd. However let him
attack, if he likes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon my word the wheel of State has turned
round gaily and with less noise than I had expected:
more quickly to be sure than it might have done.
That is Cato’s fault, but it is still more through the
villainy of those who have disregarded auspices and
the Aelian law, the Iunian and Licinian law and the
Caecilian and Didian law, who have thrown out of
the window all the physic for the State, who have
given kingdoms to tetrarchs as though they were
farms and immense sums of money to one or two
people. I can see already which way jealousy
is tending and where it will come home to roost.
Count me too big a dunce to have learned anything
by experience or from Theophrastus, if you
do not see very shortly men mourning for the days
of my government. For if the power of the Senate
was unpopular, you can imagine what things will be
like now, when the power has been transferred not
to the people, but to three unbridled men. So let
them make anyone they like consuls and tribunes,</p>

when my friend Curio met me, fresh from Rome:
and at the very same moment your man with a letter.
Curio inquired whether I hadn’t heard the news.
“No,” said I. “Publius is standing for the tribuneship,”
says he. “You don’t say so!” “And he is at deadly
enmity with Caesar,” he replies, “and wants to annul
all those laws of his.” “And what is Caesar doing?” I
inquired. “He is denying that he ever proposed Clodius’
adoption.” Then he emptied the vials of his own
wrath and that of Memmius and Metellus Nepos. I embraced
the youth and said good-bye, being in a hurry to
get to your letters. What a lot of nonsense is talked
about “viva vox”? Why, I learned a dozen times as
much about affairs from your letter as from his talk—the
daily chit-chat, the designs of Publius, Juno’s war-cries,
how Athenio<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c012'><sup>[71]</sup></a> is raising the standard, his letter</p>

my side, if anything of the kind were to happen. But,
even if this does not happen, I am looking forward

<p class='c007'>As I was taking a nap after dinner on the last of
April, your letter about the Campanian land arrived.
Well, at first it startled me so that it banished all
desire to sleep, though it was thought rather than
uneasiness that kept me awake. The result of my
cogitations was something of this sort. First, when
you said in your last letter you had heard from a great
friend of Caesar’s that some proposal was going to
be made to which no one could object, I had feared
some sweeping measure; but this I don’t consider
anything of the kind. Secondly—and that is some
consolation to me—all hope of agrarian distribution
seems to have been diverted to the Campanian land.
Supposing that the allotments are about 6 acres
apiece, that land will not hold more than 5,000
people; so they have to offend all the rest of the
masses. Besides, if anything is calculated to arouse
a fiercer pitch of indignation in the minds of the
conservatives, who are obviously getting roused
already, this is the very thing that will; all the more
so because there won’t be any home tax left except
the 5 per cent.,<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c012'><sup>[76]</sup></a> now that the customs duties have
been abolished, if the Campanian land is distributed:
and that, I fancy, it would take only one petty
harangue assisted by the cheers of our lacqueys to
abolish. What on earth our friend Gnaeus is thinking
of in letting himself be carried so far, I cannot tell:</p>

saying that he approved of Caesar’s laws, but it
was for Caesar to see to their passing: that the agrarian
law was sound enough to his mind, but whether
it could be vetoed by a tribune or not did not matter
to him: he thought it was high time the question
was settled with the king of Alexandria: whether
Bibulus had been watching for omens or not at that
particular moment was no business of his: as for the
tax-gatherers, they were a class that he wished to
oblige: what was going to happen, if Bibulus came
down to the forum on that occasion, he could not have
prophesied. But now what has the Pasha got to say
for himself? That he imposed a tax on Antilibanus
and took it off the Campanian land? Well, I don’t
see how he will make it good. “I will keep you in
check with Caesar’s army,” he says. No, not me at
least; that army will not restrain me so much as the
ungrateful minds of the so-called constitutionalists,
who have not repaid my services even by thanks,
much less by more substantial rewards. But, if I
were really to rouse myself to energy against that
party, I would certainly find some means of resisting
them. As it is, since there is such an endless controversy
between your intimate Dicaearchus and my
friend Theophrastus, Dicaearchus giving the preference
to a practical life, Theophrastus to a contemplative,
I have set my mind on making it clear that
I have humoured them both. I take it I have fully
satisfied Dicaearchus: now I am turning my eye to
the other school, which not only gives me permission
to take my ease now, but blames me for ever having
done anything else. So, my dear Titus, let me throw
myself heart and soul into those excellent studies,</p>

<p class='c007'>As for your complaints about my brother Quintus’
letter, to me, too, it seemed “a lion before, behind”—heaven
knows what. For the groans in the first
lines about his long absence would touch anybody’s
heart: then afterwards he calms down sufficiently to
ask me to touch up and edit his journal. Please pay
some attention to the point you mention about the
dues on goods transferred from port to port. He
says he referred it to the Senate by the advice of his
assessors. Evidently he had not read my letter, in
which I told him after careful consideration and research
that no tax was legally due. If any Greeks
have come from Asia to Rome about it, please see
them, and, it you think fit, tell them my opinion. If
I can recant, I will do as the tax collectors wish,
rather than see the good cause worsted in the
House: but, if not, I candidly confess I prefer the
interests of the whole of Asia and the merchants, for
I feel it is really a matter of great importance to
them. I think, however, it is a case of necessity for
us. But you will see to it. Are the quaestors, then,
still debating about the currency? If there is no
escape from it in spite of all our efforts, I shouldn’t
turn up my nose at the Asiatic coins as the last
resource. I shall see you at Arpinum, and give you
a country welcome, since you have despised this at
the seaside.</p>

possibly give them any pleasure: and they would
never have taken this step except as the first to other

service especially in civic and political matters. Nay
more, the little strain of vanity and thirst for fame
that there is in me—it is a good thing to recognize
one’s own faults—even experiences a pleasurable
sensation. For the thought that the Pasha’s services
to the country might in the dim future be reckoned
higher than mine, used to prick me to the heart:
but now I rest quite easy on that score. He has
fallen so low that the fallen Curius in comparison

<p class='c007'>I have received several letters of yours, and from
them I see with what tense anxiety you are looking
forward to news. We are hemmed in on every side;
yet we do not rebel at servitude, fearing death and
exile as though they were greater evils, whereas
they are really far lesser evils. Yes, that is the
position, and though every one groans about it, not a
voice is raised to relieve it. The object, I presume,
of those who hold the reins is to leave nothing for
anyone else to give away. One man only opens his
mouth and opposes them publicly, and that is young
Curio. The loyal party cheers him loudly, greets
him in the forum with the highest respect, and shows
its good-will to him in many other ways, while Fufius
is pursued with shouts and jeers and hisses. But
this raises not one’s hope so much as one’s disgust at
seeing the people’s will so free and their courage so
enslaved. And, not to enter into details with you,
affairs have come to such a pass that there is no hope
of ever again having free magistrates, let alone a
free people. But in the midst of this tyranny speech
is freer than ever, at any rate in clubs and over our</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>cups. Disgust is beginning to conquer fear, though
it still leaves the blankest despair everywhere. The
Campanian law goes so far as to impose upon candidates
a formula of execration upon themselves if they
propose any different occupation of the land to that
laid down by the Julian laws, to be used by them in
their speech as candidates. The others showed no
compunction in taking the oath: but Laterensis is
thought a hero because he threw up his candidature
for the tribunate rather than take it.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have no heart to write more about politics. I
am disgusted with myself and it is agony to me to
write. I stand my ground without losing self-respect
considering the universal servility, but with less
courage than I could wish considering my past record.
Caesar most liberally invites me to take a place on
his personal staff: and I even have an offer of a free
travelling pass nominally to fulfil a vow.<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c012'><sup>[81]</sup></a> But it is
hardly safe to trust to that Beauty’s delicacy to that

here for my brother’s return. The other post is
much safer, and does not prevent me from being
here when I wish. The free pass I have, but I don’t
think I shall use it. No one knows of it however.
I don’t want to run away; I long to fight. I have
plenty of ardent admirers. But I won’t take my
oath on anything, and please don’t mention what

<p class='c007'>To my infinite sorrow, my pet, Pompey, has shattered

anyone by affection: and I am afraid they may find
it necessary to try the effect of fear. I do not
quarrel with them on account of my friendship for
him, though I refrain from showing approval not to
stultify all my previous actions. I keep to the high-road.
The popular feeling can be seen best in the
theatre and at public exhibitions. For at the gladiatorial
show both the leader<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c012'><sup>[84]</sup></a> and his associates
were overwhelmed with hisses: at the games in
honour of Apollo the actor Diphilus made an impertinent
attack on Pompey, “By our misfortunes thou
art Great,” which was encored again and again. “A
time will come when thou wilt rue that might” he declaimed
amid the cheers of the whole audience, and
so on with the rest. For indeed the verses do look
as though they had been written for the occasion by
an enemy of Pompey: “If neither law nor custom
can constrain,” etc. was received with a tremendous
uproar and outcry. At Caesar’s entry the applause

applauded as Pompey used to be when the constitution

and clapped Curio, and their hand is against every
man’s. They are threatening the Roscian law and
even the corn law. Things are in a most disturbed
condition. I used to think it would be best silently
to ignore their doings, but I am afraid that will be
impossible. The public cannot put up with things,

making hostile advances: there is trouble ahead, and
you must fly to the rescue. I think I have at my
back the same firm bodyguard of all the sound men
and even the moderately sound, as I had in my consulship.
The affection Pompey shows me is more
than ordinary. He declares Clodius will not say a
word against me: but there he is deceiving himself
not me. I have been asked to fill Cosconius’ place<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c012'><sup>[85]</sup></a>

man’s shoes, with a vengeance! I should disgrace
myself utterly in the world’s eyes: and nothing
could be more opposed to the state of safety you
keep talking of. For that board is unpopular with
the loyal party, and so I should keep my unpopularity
with the disloyal and take up another’s burden too.
Caesar wants me to go as his lieutenant. That would
be a more honourable way of getting out of danger.

<p class='c007'>Political matters I shall only touch on briefly: for
I am beginning to be afraid that the very paper may
betray me. So in future, if I have to write in fuller
detail to you, I shall hide my meaning under covert
language. Now the State is dying of a new disease.
The measures that have been passed cause universal
discontent and grumbling and indignation: there is
no disagreement on the point and people are now
venting their opinion and their disapproval openly
and loudly, yet no remedy is applied. Resistance
seems impossible without bloodshed: nor can we see
any other end to concession except destruction.
Bibulus is exalted to the skies amid universal admiration
and popularity. His edicts and speeches are
copied out and read. He has attained the height of
glory in quite a novel way. Nothing is so popular
now as hatred of the popular party. I have my fears
about the issue of all this. But I will write more
clearly, if I get any definite views. Do you, if your
affection for me is as real as I know it to be, hold
yourself ready to run to my call, when it comes. But
I am doing my best, and will continue to do it, to
prevent any necessity. I said I would call you Furius
in my letters, but there is no need to alter your
name. I will call myself Laelius and you Atticus,
and I won’t use my own handwriting or seal, at any
rate if the letters are such that I should not like
them to fall into a stranger’s hands.</p>

have happened, if people could only have waited for
the storm to pass. But for a while they stifled their

all set about airing their grievances at the top of
their voices. And so our friend, being unused to

and now, how humble he was, how cast
down, and what discontent he aroused in himself as

have enjoyed it, but no one else. For seeing that
he had fallen from the stars, one could not but attribute
his swift descent to accident rather than to
voluntary motion. And, just as Apelles or Protogenes,
if they had seen their Venus or Ialysus smeared

edicts against him are so popular, that one can’t pass
the place where they are posted up for the crowd of
people reading them. Pompey finds them so distressing
that he is wasting away with grief; and I
myself am much annoyed with them, partly because
they cause so much pain to a man whom I have always
loved, and partly for fear that being so impulsive and
ready to draw the sword, as well as so unused to abuse,
he may give full reins to his indignation and wrath.</p>

<p class='c007'>I don’t know what will be the end of Bibulus.
As things stand at present his reputation is extraordinarily
high. When he put off the elections till
October, which generally annoys the populace, Caesar
thought he could induce the people by a speech to
attack Bibulus: but in spite of all his seditious talk, he
could not ring a word out of anybody. In short they feel
that they have lost the good-will of all parties: and so
violent action on their part is all the more to be feared.</p>

<p class='c007'>Clodius is hostile to me. Pompey assures me he
will do nothing against me: but I am afraid to trust
him and am getting ready for resistance. I hope I
shall have very strong support from all classes. For
your presence I have a longing myself and circumstances
call for it to meet the crisis. If I see you
in time, I shall feel it a great accession to my policy,
my courage and my safety. Varro is very obliging;
and Pompey talks like an angel. I hope that in the
end I shall either be certain of a glorious victory, or
even escape unmolested. Let me know what you
are doing, how you are enjoying yourself, and what
has happened as regards the Sicyonians.</p>

have stayed, if we had thought this was going

little Beauty in order or at any rate should have
known what he was going to do. As it is he flits

he threatens lots of people, but will probably do
whatever turns up. When he sees the general abhorrence
of the present state of affairs he seems to
meditate an attack on the authors of it; but when
he remembers the armed force behind them, he turns
his wrath against the loyalists. As for me, he

that he would become a byword for treachery and
underhandedness, if my life were threatened by one
whose weapons he himself had forged by acquiescing
in his transference to the plebs: that both he and
Appius had pledged their word for me: and that,
unless Clodius respected their promise, he would be
so annoyed that he would make it plain to the world
that he prized my friendship beyond everything.
He declared that after he had said this and much
more to the same effect, Clodius at first persisted in
arguing the point at length, but finally gave way and</p>

Since then, however, he has not ceased to speak very
unpleasantly about me: but, even if he did not, I
should not believe him and should continue the preparations
which I am making.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the present time I am managing things so that
my popularity and the strength of my position increases
daily. Politics I am not touching at all, but
am busily engaged in the law courts and in my other
forensic work: and thereby I find I win extraordinary
favour not only with those who enjoy my services,
but with the people in general too. My house is
thronged with folk; processions meet me; the days
of my consulship are recalled; friendships are not
disguised: and my hopes are so raised that I often
think there is no reason for me to shrink from the
struggle which threatens.</p>

<p class='c007'>What I want now is your advice and your affection
and loyalty: so fly to me. It will simplify everything,
if I have you with me. Varro can render me many
services, but they would be far surer if you were
here to support them: a great deal of information
can be extracted from Publius himself, and a great
deal found out, which could not possibly be kept
from your ears: besides a great deal more—but it is
absurd to specify details, when I want you for everything.
The one point I want you to grasp is that
the mere sight of you would simplify everything for
me; but it all depends on your coming before he
enters on his office. I think that, though Crassus is
egging on Pompey, if you were here and could find
out from the enemy through Juno how far the great
men are to be trusted, I should either escape molestation
altogether or at any rate I should no longer be</p>

in familiaritatem adulescentis et cum eo, ut res indicat,

id eiectum est, quod a. d. III Idus Mai. Bibulus

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>not be so troublesome at the end as at the beginning.
That fellow Vettius, my famous informer, promised
Caesar, so far as we can see, that he would get some
criminal suspicion thrown on young Curio. So he
wormed his way into intimacy with the young man
and after meeting him often, as events prove, he went
so far as to declare that he was determined to make
an attack on Pompey with the assistance of his slaves,
and to slay him. Curio told his father of this, and
he told Pompey. The affair was reported to the
Senate. Vettius was summoned before them and at
first denied that he had ever had an appointment
with Curio. However he did not stick to that tale
long; but at once claimed the privilege of king’s
evidence. Amid cries of “no,” he began to explain
that there had been a confederacy of the younger
men under the leadership of Curio, to which Paulus
at first belonged and Q. Caepio, Brutus I mean, and
Lentulus, the flamen’s son, with his father’s consent;
and then that C. Septimius, Bibulus’ secretary, had
brought him a dagger from Bibulus. The idea of
Vettius not having a dagger, unless the consul gave
him one, and the rest of it, was too much for anybody’s
gravity: and the charge was scouted the more
because Bibulus had warned Pompey on the 13th of
May to be on his guard against plots; and Pompey
had thanked him for the advice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Young Curio was brought in and repelled Vettius’
assertions: and the point for which Vettius was especially
jumped on was saying that the young men’s
intention was to attack Pompey in the forum at the
gladiatorial show which Gabinius gave, and that Paulus
was to be the leader, when it was well known that
he was in Macedonia at the time. The House decreed</p>

<p class='c007'>consultum, ut Vettius, quod confessus esset se cum
telo fuisse, in vincula coniceretur; qui emisisset, eum
contra rem publicam esse facturum. Res erat in ea
opinione, ut putarent id esse actum, ut Vettius in foro
cum pugione et item servi eius comprehenderentur
cum telis, deinde ille se diceret indicaturum. Idque
ita factum esset, nisi Curiones rem ante ad Pompeium
detulissent. Tum senatus consultum in contione
recitatum est. Postero autem die Caesar, is qui olim,
praetor cum esset, Q. Catulum ex inferiore loco iusserat
dicere, Vettium in rostra produxit eumque in
eo loco constituit, quo Bibulo consuli adspirare non
liceret. Hic ille omnia, quae voluit de re publica,
dixit, et qui illuc factus institutusque venisset, primum
Caepionem de oratione sua sustulit, quem in
senatu acerrime nominarat, ut appareret noctem et
nocturnam deprecationem intercessisse. Deinde,
quos in senatu ne tenuissima quidem suspicione attigerat,
eos nominavit, L. Lucullum, a quo solitum
esse ad se mitti C. Fannium, illum qui in P. Clodium
subscripserat, L. Domitium, cuius domum constitutam
fuisse, unde eruptio fieret. Me non nominavit, sed
dixit consularem disertum vicinum consulis sibi
dixisse Ahalam Servilium aliquem aut Brutum opus
esse reperiri. Addidit ad extremum, cum iam dimissa
contione revocatus a Vatinio fuisset, se audisse
a Curione his de rebus conscium esse Pisonem, generum
meum, et M. Laterensem.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nunc reus erat apud Crassum Divitem Vettius de
vi et, cum esset damnatus, erat indicium postulaturus.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>that Vettius should be committed on his own confession
of having carried a weapon; and that it should be
high treason to release him. The view most generally
held is that it was a put up job: Vettius was to be
discovered in the forum with a dagger and his slaves
round him with weapons, and then he was to turn
king’s evidence: and it would have come off, if the
Curios had not reported the matter to Pompey. Then
the senatorial decree was read aloud to an assembly.
On the next day, however, Caesar, the man who as
praetor some years ago had bidden Q. Catulus speak
from the floor, brought Vettius out on the rostra, and
set him in a place which was beyond Bibulus’ aspiration,
though a consul. Here he said anything he liked
about public affairs; and, as he had come ready
primed and tutored, he omitted all mention of Caepio,
though he had named him most emphatically in
the House: so it was obvious that a night and a nocturnal
appeal had intervened. Then he mentioned
people on whom he had not cast the slightest suspicion
in the House,—L. Lucullus, who, he said,
generally used to send to him C. Fannius, the man
who once supported a prosecution of P. Clodius,
and L. Domitius, whose house was to be the basis of
operations. My name he did not mention, but he
said that an eloquent ex-consul, a neighbour of the
consul, had remarked to him that we stood in need
of a Servilius Ahala or a Brutus. He added at the
end, when he had been called back by Vatinius after
the assembly was dismissed, that he had heard from
Curio that Piso, my son-in-law, was in the plot, and
M. Laterensis too.</p>

and circumstances and the times call for you as much
as I do.</p>

relieve all my cares or share them with me. If I am
rather brief, it is because I hope that I may soon be

service to me to have you with me, but when I read

you I could not stay in those districts on account of
Autronius.  Now, as I said in my last letter, if you

<p class='c007'>I arrived at Brundisium on April 17, and on the
same day your men delivered a letter from you.
The next day but one some others brought me
another letter.  I am very grateful for your kind
invitation to stay at your place in Epirus, though I
expected it. It is a plan, which would have just
suited me, if I could have stayed there all the time.
1 hate a crowd, I shun my fellow-men, I can hardly
bear to look upon the light: so the solitude there,
especially as I am so at home there, would have been
far from unpleasant. But for stopping on the route it
is too far out of the way: moreover I should be only
four days’ march from Autronius and the rest, moreover
you would not be there yourself. Yes, a fortified
place would be useful to me if I were settling there,
but it is unnecessary, when I am merely passing. If
I dared, I should make for Athens; and things were
turning out right for it: but now my enemies are
there, you have not joined me, and I am afraid that
town too may not be counted far enough away from
Italy. Nor have you let me know when I may
expect you.</p>

<p class='c007'>Your pleas to me not to think of suicide have one
result that I refrain from laying violent hands on
myself; but you cannot make me cease to regret our
decision and my existence. What is there for me to
live for, especially if I have lost even that hope I had
when I set out? I will forbear to mention all the
miseries into which I have fallen through the villainous
machinations not so much of my enemies, as of</p>

I shall see him, nor how I shall tear myself from

Macedonia. So I sent a note to catch him at Athens,
asking him to come on to Thessalonica, and I myself
set off and arrived at Thessalonica on the 23rd of
May. The only certain news about him, that I have
had, is that he started a short time ago from Ephesus.
Now I am in great anxiety to know what is happening
at Rome. It is true that in one letter dated May 15
you say you have heard that Quintus will be rigorously
called in question, and in another that things
are calming down: but the latter is dated a day before
the former, to increase my perplexity. So, what
between my own personal grief, which racks and tortures
me daily, and this additional anxiety, I have
hardly any life left in me. But the passage was very
bad and perhaps, not knowing where I was, he took
some other direction. My freedman Phaetho has seen
nothing of him. Phaetho was driven back by wind
from Ilium to Macedonia and came to me at Pella.
I see how threatening the future is, though I have
not the heart to write. I am afraid of everything:
there is no misfortune that does not seem to fall to
my lot. I am still staying in suspense at Thessalonica,
with this new fear added to the woes and
sorrows that oppress me; and I do not dare to make
a move of any kind.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now for the things you mention in your letter.
Caecilius Trypho I have not seen. Of your talk with
Pompey I have heard from your letter. I cannot see
such signs of a political change as you either see or
invent to comfort me: for, if they take no notice of
the Tigranes episode, all hope is lost. You bid me
pay my thanks to Varro. I will, and to Hypsaeus
too. I think I will follow your advice not to go any</p>

<p class='c007'>From these rambling notes of mine, you can see
the perturbed state of my wits. Yet, though I have
been crushed by an incredible and unparalleled misfortune,
it is not so much my misery as the remembrance
of my own mistake that affects me. For now
surely you see whose treachery egged me on and
betrayed me. Would to heaven you had seen it before,
and had not let a mistake dominate your mind
as I did. So when you hear that I am crushed and
overwhelmed with grief, be assured that the sense
of my folly in trusting one, whose treachery I had
not suspected, is a heavier penalty than all the consequences.
The thought of my misfortunes and my
fears for my brother prevent me from writing. Keep
your eye on events and your hand at the helm. Terentia
expresses the deepest gratitude to you. I have
sent you a copy of the letter I wrote to Pompey.</p>

insidiis, quorum scelere perierimus? Sed tecum haec

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>truth and it will show you the depth of my misery—I
could not bear in my great distress to look on one
so devoted to me and so tender-hearted, nor could I
thrust upon him the misery of my affliction and my
fallen fortune, or suffer him to see me. Besides I
was afraid of what would have been sure to happen—that
he would not be able to part from me. The
picture of the moment when he would have had to
dismiss his lictors or to be torn by force from my arms
was ever before me. The bitterness of parting I have
avoided by the bitterness of not seeing my brother.
That is the kind of dilemma into which you who are
responsible for my survival have forced me; and so
I have to pay the penalty for my mistake. Your
letter however cheers me, though I can easily see
from it how little hope you have yourself. Still it
offered some little consolation till you passed from
your mention of Pompey to the passage: “Now
try to win over Hortensius and such people.” In
heaven’s name, my dear Pomponius, have you not
yet grasped, whose agency, whose villainy and whose
treachery have ruined me? But that I will discuss
when I meet you. Now I will only say, what
you must surely know, that it is not so much my
enemies as my enviers who have ruined me. If
there is any real foundation for your hopes, I will
bear up and rely on the hope you suggest. But if,
as seems probable to me, your hopes are ill-founded,
then I will do now what you would not let me do
before, though the time is far less appropriate.</p>

I shall look for something else.  At present you do
not give me the least hint of anything except the
disagreement of those friends of yours: and they are
quarrelling about anything rather than me, so I do
not see what good it will do me. But, as long as you

intentions or professed intentions as regards me. For
I think the elections have been held, and it is when

of your opinion as to Pompey’s wishes. My answer
to the first is that though I am distressed, it has not

though my mind is so sound, I have neither place nor
opportunity for using it.  For, if you feel the loss of
a single friend like myself, what do you suppose my

only open my wound again. But this I do assert that
no one has ever lost so much and no one has ever
fallen into such a depth of misery. Time too, instead
of lightening my grief, can but add to it: for other
sorrows lose their sting as time passes, but my sorrow
can but grow daily, as I feel my present misery and
think on my past happiness. I mourn the loss not
only of my wealth and my friends but of my old self.
For what am I now? But I will not wring your soul
with my complaints nor keep fingering my sore.</p>

<p class='c007'>You write in defence of those who, I said, envied
me and among them Cato. Of him I have not the
least suspicion: indeed I am sorry that the false
friendship of others had more weight with me than
his loyalty. As to the others I suppose I should acquit
them if you do. But it is too late to matter now.</p>

<p class='c007'>I don’t think Crassus’ freedman meant what he
said. You say things went well in the House. But
what about Curio? Hasn’t he read that speech?
Goodness knows how it got published. Axius however,
writing on the same day an account of the
meeting, has less to say for Curio. Still he might
well miss something, while you would certainly not
have written what was not true. Varro’s talk with
you gives me hopes of Caesar. I only wish Varro
himself would throw his weight into my cause; and
I think he will with a little pressing from you, if
not of his own accord.</p>

<p class='c007'>If ever I have the fortune to see you and my
country again, I will not fail to give you more cause
for joy at my recall than all my other friends: and,

suffered me to stand in need of that sound common

only gave your tears to my distress, as a tribute of
affection: and it was my fault, not yours, that you did
not devote day and night to pondering on the course
I should take, as you might have done, if my claims
on you had been stronger. If you or anyone had
dissuaded me from the disgraceful resolve I formed
in my alarm at Pompey’s ungenerous reply,—and
you were the person best qualified to do so—I should
either have died with honour, or should to-day be
living in triumph. You will pardon what I have
said. I am blaming myself far more than you, and
you only as my second self, and because I want a
companion in my guilt. If I am restored, our common
guilt will seem far less, and you, at any rate,
will hold me dear for services rendered, not received,

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>You mention talking to Culleo about this bill being
directed against an individual.<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c012'><sup>[102]</sup></a> There is something
in that point: but it is much better to have it repealed.
If no one vetoes it, it is by far the surest
course. If on the other hand anyone is opposed to
it, he will veto the Senate’s decree too. There is no
necessity to repeal anything else as well: the former
law did not touch me. If we had had the sense to
support it when it was brought forward, or to take
no notice of it, which was all it deserved, it never
would have done us any harm. It was then I first
lost the use of my wits, or rather used them to my
own destruction. It was blind, absolutely blind of
us to put on mourning, to appeal to the crowd—a
fatal thing to do before I was attacked personally.
But I keep harping on what is over and done with.
My point, however, is to urge you, when you do
make a move, not to touch that law on account of
its claims to popularity. But it is absurd of me to
lay down what you should do or how. If only something
could be done! And on that very point I am
afraid your letters keep back a good deal, to save me
from giving way to even deeper despair. What
course of action do you suppose can be taken and
how? Through the Senate? But you yourself have
told me that a clause of Clodius’ bill, forbidding any
motion or reference to my case, has been posted up
in the House. How then does Domitius propose to
make a motion? And how is it that Clodius holds
his tongue, when the men you mention talk about

<p class='c007'>All the news I have had about my brother Quintus
from June the 3rd to the end of August has been
bad news without exception. But on the last of
August Livineius, who had been sent by his former
master, L. Regulus, came to me. He assured me that
no notice whatever had been given of a prosecution
though there was some talk of C. Clodius’ son undertaking
one: and he brought me letters from Quintus
himself. But on the next day came some of Sestius’
men, with some letters of yours which are not so
positive and alarming as Livineius’ conversation was.
My own unending distress of course renders me
anxious, all the more so, as Appius would preside at
the trial.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the rest of your remarks in the same letter
as to my own chances, I infer that our hopes are fainter
than others make out. But since it will not be
long now before the matter is settled, I will either
remove to your house or still stay somewhere round
here.</p>

<p class='c007'>My brother writes that you alone are his support.
I need not urge you to efforts, which you make of
your own accord, nor will I offer my thanks, since you
do not expect them. I only hope fate may allow us
to enjoy our affection in safety. I am always looking
eagerly for your letters: and please don’t be afraid
either of boring me with your minuteness or paining
me by telling the truth.</p>

<p class='c007'>You raised my hopes considerably by writing that
Varro had assured you as a friend that Pompey was
going to take up my case, and that he would appoint
an agent as soon as he had received a letter which he
was expecting from Caesar. Did it come to nothing?
Or was Caesar’s letter hostile? Or is there still room
for hope? You mentioned too that he used the
words “after the elections.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Please do let me have full information as to the
state of my case,—you know the anxiety I am in and
how kind it would be of you. For my brother, a
dear good fellow and very fond of me, sends me
nothing but hopeful news, for fear, I suppose, that I
should entirely lose heart. Whereas your letters
vary in tone; for your intention is neither to cast me
into despondency nor to raise rash hopes in me.
Pray do let me know everything you may succeed
in discovering.</p>

that I shun the light of day entirely, but I should
like to sail back to freedom from a port of yours,

either my dear and only brother’s sad and touching
entreaties, nor the promises of Sestius and others, nor

I have been robbed of my honours and of my dearest

advice I relied, as you know how I was forced into
betraying myself and my family, of your pity help me,
and support my brother Quintus, who is not past
salvation: guard Terentia and my children; as for
me, wait for me in Rome, if you think there is any
chance of seeing me there. If not, come to see me,

body to rest in; and send a man with letters as soon
and as often as possible.</p>

has done his duty by you meets with my heartiest
approval; I will reserve the phrase “I am glad” for a
time when circumstances may permit of my using the
word. Poor devil that I am! Everything would be
going as right as possible with me, if my own courage
and judgement and the loyalty of those in whom I
trusted had not failed me. But I will not piece my
misfortunes together, for fear of increasing my misery.
I am sure you must recollect my former life and its
charm and dignity. In the name of good luck and
bad, do not let the efforts you are making to recover
my position relax; and let me celebrate the birthday
of my return in your delightful house with you
and my family. Though my hopes and expectations
of return have been roused to the highest pitch, I
still thought of awaiting their fulfilment at your house
in Epirus: but from letters I infer it would be more
convenient for me not to be in the same neighbourhood.</p>

<p class='c007'>You are quite right about my house and Curio’s
speech. If only restoration is promised in general

<p class='c007'>Though my brother Quintus and Piso have sent
me careful accounts of what has been done, I am
sorry you were too busy to write your usual full
description of events and of your surmises. Plancius’
kindness keeps me here still, though I have several
times tried to go to Epirus.  He is inspired with a
hope, which I do not share, that we may return together:
which he hopes would redound to his honour.
But now, as soon as news arrives of the approach of
the soldiers, I shall have to make an effort to leave
him. When I do, I will send word to you at once and
let you know where I am. The courtesy which Lentulus
shows in his actions, his promises and his letters,
gives me some hope of Pompey’s good will: for you
have often mentioned that he would do anything for
him. With Metellus, my brother tells me, you have
had as much success as he hoped. My dear Pomponius,
fight hard for me to be allowed to live with you
and with my family; and send me all the news. I am
bowed down with grief through my longing for all
my dear ones, who have always been dearer to me
than myself. Take care of yourself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Knowing that I should be a very long time without
any news, if I went to Epirus through Thessaly,
and that the people of Dyrrachium were warm
friends of mine, I have come to them, after writing
the first part of this letter at Thessalonica. As soon
as I leave here and go to your house, I will let you
know; and please write me every detail of whatsoever
kind. Now I look either for the fulfilment of
my hopes or for blank despair.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 26th of November I received three letters
from you. In one of them, posted on the 25th of
October, you exhort me to keep up my courage and
wait for January, and you give a full list of all the
hopeful signs, Lentulus’ zeal for my cause, Metellus’
good will and Pompey’s policy. One of the others is
undated, which is unlike you; but you give a clear
clue to the time, for you say you were writing it on
the very day that the bill was published by the eight
tribunes, that is to say the 29th of October: and you
state the advantages you think have resulted from
the publication of the law. If my restoration and
this law together are long past praying for, I hope
your affection will make you regard the trouble I am
taking about it with pity rather than amusement.
But, if there is still some hope, please see to it that
our new magistrates set up a more careful case.
For the old tribunes’ bill had three sections, and the
one about my return was carelessly worded; it does
not provide for the restitution of anything but my
citizenship and my position. In my fallen fortunes
that is enough for me, but you cannot fail to see what
ought to have been stipulated and how. The second
clause is the usual form of indemnity: “If in virtue
of this law there be any breach of other laws,” etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>But it is the third clause, Pomponius, to which
I would call your attention. What is its object, and
who put it in? You know that Clodius had so provided
that it was almost, if not quite impossible for
either the Senate or the people to annul his law;</p>

which are repealed are never regarded, otherwise
hardly any law ever would be repealed; for there
never is a law which did not hedge itself in with
obstacles against its repeal. But, when a law is repealed,
the provisions against repeal are repealed
likewise. Though this is the case, and always has
been in theory and in practice, our eight tribunes have
thought fit to insert a clause: “If there be anything
contained in this bill, which by law or popular decree,”
that is by Clodius’ law, “cannot now or hereafter be
brought forward, whether by way of proposal, repeal,
amendment or modification, without penalty, or
without involving the author of the proposal or amendment
in a penalty or fine, no such proposal is made in
this law.” And yet these tribunes did not run any
risks; as a law made by one of their own body was not
binding on them. That increases my suspicion that
there is some trickery about it, as they have inserted
a clause which does not apply to themselves, but is
against my interest; and as a result the new tribunes,
if they should happen to be rather timid, would suppose
that clause still more indispensable. Nor did
Clodius overlook the point: for in the meeting on
November the third he said that this clause defined
the powers of the tribunes elect. Yet you know quite
well that no such clause is ever inserted in a law:
and, if it were necessary, everybody would use it
when repealing a law. Please try to find out how this
clause escaped the notice of Ninnius and the rest, also
who inserted it, and why the eight tribunes, after
showing no hesitation about bringing my case before
the House—which proves they did not think</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>that section need be taken seriously—yet when it
came to repealing the law, became so cautious that
they feared a rule, which even those who are bound
by the law do not regard, though they themselves were
not bound by it. That clause I would rather the new
tribunes did not propose; but do let them pass
something—anything. I shall be quite contented
with a single clause of recall, if only the matter can
be settled. For some time past I have been ashamed
of writing such long letters. For by the time you
read this I am afraid that there may be no hope left,
and that all my trouble may serve only to make you
pity and others laugh. But, if there is any hope left,
look at the bill which Visellius has drawn up for
Fadius: it takes my fancy very much, whereas our
friend Sestius’ proposal, which you say has your approval,
does not please me at all.</p>

<p class='c007'>The third letter is dated November 12, and in it
you go through the reasons which you think are
causing delay in my case, thoughtfully and carefully,
mentioning Crassus, Pompey and the rest. Now, if
there is the least chance of getting the matter settled
by the good offices and authority of the conservatives
and by getting a large mass of supporters, for heaven’s
sake try to break the barrier down at a rush: devote
yourself to it and incite others to join. But if, as I infer
from your guesses as well as mine, there is no hope
left, then I beg and pray you to cherish my poor
brother Quintus, whom I have involved in my own
ruin, and not to let him pursue any rash course which
would endanger your sister’s son. Watch over my
poor little boy, to whom I leave nothing but the
hatred and the disgrace of my name, so far as you
can, and support Terentia with your kindness in her</p>

<p class='c007'>When you wrote to me some time ago that the
estimates for the consular provinces<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c012'><sup>[106]</sup></a> were passed with
your consent, I hoped you saw some good reason or
other for that course, though I was afraid of the
result: but now that I have been told by word of
mouth and by letter that your policy was severely
criticized, I am much disturbed at seeing the faint
hope I had apparently taken from me. For, if the
tribunes are annoyed with us, what hope is left?
And they seem to me to have every reason for annoyance,
when they were left out of the plan, though
they had espoused my cause, and by our concession
they have lost all use of their just right, especially as
they assert that it was for my sake they wished to
exercise their powers in fitting out the consuls, with
a view not to oppose them but to attach them to my
cause. But now if the consuls choose to stand aloof
from me, they are perfectly free to do so, while, if
they take my part, they can do nothing against the
tribunes’ will. As for your writing that, if you had</p>

came into office; but for some reason it had been arranged
earlier on this occasion.</p>

same through the people, that could never have
happened, if the tribunes opposed it. So I am afraid
that I have lost the tribunes’ favour, and that, if
it is still retained, the bond which should have
united the consuls with them has been lost.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is another considerable disadvantage too.
There was a strong opinion, or so at least it was reported
to me, that the Senate would not pass any
measure until my case was settled. That is now lost,
and in a case where there was no necessity whatever;
indeed the proceeding was unusual and unprecedented.
For I do not think the estimates for the
provinces were ever passed before the consuls entered
on their office. The result is that, now that the firm
resolution formed in favour of my case has been
broken for this one occasion, there is no reason why
any decree should not be passed. I don’t wonder
that those friends to whom the question was referred
agreed to it: it would of course have been difficult to
find anyone who would openly oppose a measure so
favourable to the two consuls. It would have been
very difficult too not to oblige so good a friend as
Lentulus, or Metellus, considering his kindness in
laying aside his quarrel with me. But I am afraid
that, while we could have retained their friendship
in any case, we have thrown away that of the tribunes.
Please write and tell me what the result has been,
and how my whole case stands, as freely as you have
before. For, however unpleasant the truth may be, I
am grateful for it.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as I reached Rome and there was anyone
to whom I could safely entrust a letter to you, my
first thought was to write and thank you for my
return, since you are not here to receive my thanks.
For I grasped, to tell you the truth, that though in
the advice you gave me you showed yourself no wiser
and no braver than myself, and indeed, considering
my past attentions to you, you were none too energetic
in defence of my honour, still, though at first you
shared my mistake or rather my madness and my
unnecessary fright, it was you who took my exile most
to heart and contributed most energy, zeal and perseverance
in bringing about my return. And so I can
assure you that in the midst of great rejoicing and
the most gratifying congratulations, one thing was
lacking to fill the cup of my happiness, the sight of
you or rather your embrace. When once I have
obtained that, I shall certainly think myself undeserving
of this renewal of good fortune, if ever I
let you go again, and if I do not exact to the full all
arrears in the enjoyment of your pleasant society.</p>

<p class='c007'>As regards my political position, I have attained

distinction at the Bar, my authority in the
House and more popularity with the sound party
than I desire. But you know how my private property
has been crippled, dissipated, plundered. I</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>am in great difficulties with it and stand in need not
so much of your means, which I know I can look
upon as my own, as of your advice to gather the fragments
together and arrange matters.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, though I suppose you have had all the news
from your family or from messengers and rumour, I
will give you a short account of everything I think you
would rather learn from my letters. On the 4th of
August, the very day the law about me was proposed, I
started from Dyrrachium, and arrived at Brundisium on
the 5th. There my little Tullia was waiting for me, on
her own birthday, which; as it happened, was the commemoration
day of Brundisium and of the temple of
Safety near your house too. The coincidence was noticed
and the people of Brundisium held great celebrations.
On the 8th of August, while I was still at Brundisium,
I heard from Quintus that the law had been passed
in the Comitia Centuriata with extraordinary enthusiasm
of all ages and ranks in Italy who had flocked
to Rome in thousands. Then I started on my
journey amid the rejoicings of all the loyal folk of
Brundisium, and was met everywhere by deputations

thanks to the Senate<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c012'><sup>[110]</sup></a> in the House. On those two
days bread was very dear and crowds ran first to the
theatre and then to the House, crying out at Clodius’
instigation that the dearth of corn was my fault. On
the same days there were meetings of the House
about the corn supply and Pompey was called upon
by poor and rich alike to take the matter in hand.
He was more than willing; and the people asked
me by name to propose it: so I delivered my
opinion carefully. As the ex-consuls, except Messalla
and Afranius, were absent, thinking it was not safe
to record a vote, a decree was passed in accordance
with my proposal that Pompey should be appealed
to take the matter in hand and a law should be
passed. When this bill was read out, the people
received the mention of my name with applause after
the new silly fashion: and I delivered an harangue,
with the permission of all the magistrates present,
except one praetor and two tribunes. On the next
day there was a full House and all the ex-consuls
were willing to grant Pompey anything. He asked
for a committee of fifteen, naming me at the head of
them and saying that I should count as his second
self in everything. The consuls drew up a law giving
Pompey the direction of the whole corn supply in the
world for five years: Messius another granting him
the control of the treasury, and adding an army and
a fleet and higher powers than those of the local
officials in the provinces. The law we ex-consuls
proposed is regarded now as quite moderate, this</p>

the pontifices on the 29th of September. I bestowed
great pains on the matter, and, if ever I had any oratorical
ability, or even if I never had before, on that
occasion at any rate, my great indignation lent some
vigour to my style. So its publication is a debt which
I must not leave unpaid to the rising generation:
and to you I will send it very soon, whether you
want it or not. The pontifices decreed that “if the
party alleging that he had dedicated had not been appointed
by name either by order of the people or vote
of the plebs, and if he had not been commanded to do
so, either by order of the people or by vote of the plebs
then it appeared that that part of the site might
be restored to me without sacrilege,” I was congratulated
at once, everybody thinking that the
house had been adjudged to me. But all of a
sudden up gets a man to speak, at Appius’ invitation,
and announces that the pontifices have decided
in his favour and I am trying to take possession by
force: he exhorts them to follow him and Appius and
defend their shrine of Liberty. Thereupon, though
even those pliable persons were partly lost in wonder
and partly laughing at the man’s folly, I determined</p>

the Senate had given out the contract for restoring the
porch of Catulus. On the first of October there was a
full meeting of the Senate. All the pontifices who
were senators were summoned: and Marcellinus, a
strong partisan of mine, being called upon first for
his opinion, asked them what was the purport of
their decree. Then M. Lucullus speaking for all his
colleagues answered, that the pontifices had to decide
points of religion and the Senate points of law: he
and his colleagues had settled the religious point and
now in the Senate they would join the other senators
in settling the legal point. Accordingly as each of
them was called upon in his turn, he delivered a long
speech in my favour. When it came to Clodius, he
wanted to waste the whole day and spoke on endlessly,
but at last, after speaking for nearly three
hours, he was forced by the indignant outcry of the
Senate to wind up his speech. A decree was passed in
accordance with Marcellinus’ proposal with only one
dissentient voice: and then Serranus put his veto on it.
Both consuls at once referred the veto to the Senate,
and many resolute speeches were delivered: “that the
Senate approved of the restitution of my house,”
“that a contract should be drawn up for the portico
of Catulus,” “that the Senate’s resolution should be
supported by all the magistrates,” “that if any
violence occurred, the Senate would hold him responsible
who had vetoed its decree.” Serranus
showed the white feather and Cornicinus played the
same old farce: he threw off his toga and flung himself
at his son-in-law’s feet. Serranus demanded a
night to think it over. They would not grant it,
remembering the first of January. At last with my</p>

the next day the decree which I send was passed.
Then the consuls gave out the contract for the
restoration of the portico of Catulus; and the contractors
immediately pulled down that portico of his
to everybody’s satisfaction. The consuls valued my
house at nearly £18,000<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c012'><sup>[113]</sup></a> at their assessor’s advice:
and the other things very stingily—my Tusculan villa
at £4,400 and my Formian at £2,200.<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c012'><sup>[114]</sup></a> This estimate
was violently decried not only by all the conservative
party, but by the people too. If you ask me the
reason, they say it was my bashfulness, as I did not
refuse or make pressing demands. But that is not
the reason; for that in itself would have counted for
me. But the fact is, my dear Pomponius, those very
same men—you know quite well who I mean—who
cut my wings, do not wish them to grow again. But
I hope they are growing. Do you only come to me.
But I fear you may be delayed by the visit of your
and my friend Varro.</p>

<p class='c007'>There you have all that has happened. Now
you shall dip into my thoughts. I have let myself
be appointed legate to Pompey with a reservation
that it should not hamper me at all. If I did not
want to have a free hand to stand for the censorship,
if the next consuls hold a censorial election, I would
have taken a votive commission<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c012'><sup>[115]</sup></a> to nearly any shrines
or groves. For that was what suited my idea of my
interests best. But I wanted to be free either to
stand for election or to quit the city at the beginning
of summer and meanwhile I thought it good policy</p>

was knocked down: my brother Quintus’ house was
first smashed by a discharge of stones from my plot,
and then set on fire under Clodius’ orders by firebrands
hurled before the eyes of the whole city,
amidst the groans and growls—I will not say of the
loyal party, which seems to have vanished out of
existence—but simply of every human creature. He
was rushing about in a frenzy, thinking of nothing
but the slaughter of his enemies after this mad freak,
and canvassing the city quarter by quarter, openly
promising liberation to slaves. Before this, when he
was trying to shirk his trial, he had a case hard indeed
to support and obviously wrongful, but still it
was a case: he could deny things, he could put the
blame on others, he could even plead that he had the
right on his side in some respects. But after this
wreckage, arson and pillage, his own supporters have
left him in the lurch and he hardly has a hold now
even on Decimus the marshal, or Gellius: he has to
take slaves into his confidence and sees, that if he
openly commits all the murders he wishes to commit,
his case before the court will not be one whit worse
than it is now. So, on the 11th of November, as I
was going down the Sacred Way, he followed me with
his gang. There were shouts, stones, clubs, swords,
all without a moment’s warning. We stepped aside
into Tettius Damio’s hall: and those who were with
me easily prevented his roughs from entering. He
might have been killed himself: but I have got tired
of surgery and am beginning a regime cure. He
realized that there was a universal outcry not for his
prosecution but for his execution, and has since
behaved in such a way that a Catiline looks ultraconservative</p>

he attempted to storm and burn Milo’s house—the
one on the Cermalus—openly bringing men with
shields and drawn swords and others with lighted
torches to the spot at eleven o’clock in the morning.
His own headquarters during the assault were P.
Sulla’s house. Then Q. Flaccus led forth a gallant
band from Milo’s family house and slew the most
notorious of Clodius’ troop of ruffians. He wanted
to slay Clodius himself: but he was skulking in the
recesses of Sulla’s house. There followed a meeting
of the Senate on the 14th: Clodius stayed at home:
Marcellinus behaved splendidly: and everybody was
enthusiastic. Metellus with the assistance of Appius
and, mark you, your great friend<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c012'><sup>[118]</sup></a> of whose constancy
you sent me such a veracious account, tried the ruse
of talking the time away. Sestius was furious,
Clodius afterwards vowed vengeance on the city, if
his election did not take place. Marcellinus posted
up his resolution which he had in writing when he
delivered it—it provided that my entire case should
be included in the trial, the attack on my building
ground, the arson and the assault on my person, and
that all these should precede the election—and Milo
gave notice that he intended to watch the sky for
omens on all the election days.</p>

<p class='c007'>Disorderly meetings were held by Metellus, wild
meetings by Appius and raging mad meetings by
Publius. But the end of it all was that the elections
would have taken place, if Milo had not reported evil
omens in the Campus Martius. On the 19th of November
Milo took up his position in the Campus before
midnight with a large force; while Clodius in spite of</p>

show himself. Milo to the huge delight of everybody
and to his own great credit stayed there till midday:
and the three brethren’s struggle ended in disgrace,
their strength broken and their mad pride humbled.
Metellus; however, demands that the prohibition
should be repeated in the forum on the next day.
There was no necessity, he said, for Milo to come to
the Campus at night; he would be in the Comitium
at six in the morning. So on the 20th Milo went to
the Comitium in the early hours of the morning. At
daybreak Metellus came sneaking into the Campus
by something like byepaths. Milo catches the fellow
up “between the groves”<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c012'><sup>[120]</sup></a> and serves his notice: and
he retired amid loud jeers and insults from Q. Flaccus.
The 21st was a market-day, and for two days there
were no meetings.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is now three o’clock on the morning of the
23rd as I am writing. Milo has already taken possession
of the Campus. Marcellus, the candidate, is
snoring loud enough for me to hear him next door.
I have just had news that Clodius’ hall is utterly
deserted, save for a few rag and bob tails with a
canvas lantern. His side are complaining that I am
at the bottom of it all: but they little know the
courage and wisdom of that hero. His valour is
marvellous. I can’t stop to mention some of his new
strokes of genius. But this is the upshot: I believe
the elections will not be held, and Milo will bring
Publius before the bar, unless he kills him first. If
he gives him a chance in a riot, I can see Milo will
kill him with his own hands. He has got no scruples</p>

need not grieve for him—not for the same reason as
Saufeius and your Epicurean friends, but because he

providence had snatched him from his country’s
fiery ruin. For what could be more shameful than
the life we are all leading, especially myself? You,
in spite of a political bent, have avoided wearing any
special yoke; but you share the universal bondage.
But think of the sufferings I undergo, when I am taken
for a lunatic, if I say what I ought about the State, for
a slave, if I say what expediency dictates, and for a
cowed and helpless bondsman, if I hold my tongue. I
suffer as you may suppose, with the added bitterness
that I cannot show my grief without seeming ungrateful.
Well! why shouldn’t I take a rest, and flee to the
haven of retirement? I haven’t the chance. Then be
it war and camp. And so I must be a subaltern, after
refusing to be a captain. So be it. That I see is your

as he said—for that is a necessary proviso in
his case. Of Syria he expressed a very low opinion,
while he runs down<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c012'><sup>[137]</sup></a> Spain—with the same proviso
“as he said,” which I think must be inserted everywhere
when he is mentioned, like the tag “this
too is by Phocylides.” To you he expressed his thanks
for undertaking the arrangement of the statues, and
he laid himself out to be most uncommonly pleasant
to me. He even came to visit me in my house at
Cumae. The last thing he seemed to wish was
that Messalla should stand for the consulship: and
if you have any information on that point, I should
like to know it.</p>

<p class='c007'>I am most grateful to you for saying that you will
recommend me as a subject for a panegyric to Lucceius
and for your frequent visits to my house. My
brother Quintus has written that he will pay you a
visit on the 7th of May since you have his dear child
with you. I left my villa at Cumae on the 26th of
April, spent that night with Paetus at Naples, and
am writing this very early in the morning of the 27th
on my way to my place at Pompeii.</p>

of Puteoli and the Lucrine lakes. Well, I have
them too. But upon my word the more I am
deprived of other enjoyments and pleasures on
account of the state of politics, the more support and
recreation do I find in literature. And I would rather
be in that niche of yours under Aristotle’s statue
than in their curule chair, and take a walk with you
at home than have the company which I see will be
with me on my path. But my path I leave to fate or

Please have a look at my garden path and my Spartan

that I may have something in that line to match

When I say want, I mean I have to be in town for

Even if it has come off, I am not at all sorry to have
missed the disputes which I hear have taken place in

my support against my conscience, or neglect my
bounden duty.  But I hope to goodness you will
write me as full a description as possible of that
affair and of the present state of politics and tell me

everything. They say our friend Crassus made
a less dignified start<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c012'><sup>[144]</sup></a> in his uniform than L. Paulus
of old, who rivalled him in age and in his two consulships.

<p class='c007'>I suppose your journey to Asia is inevitable;
for you would never want to put such a distance
between yourself and all your nearest and dearest
friends and possessions without very good reason.
But you will show your consideration and your love
for your friends by the quickness with which you
return. I am however afraid the attractions of the
rhetorician Clodius and the reputed deep learning of
Pituanius, who just now is devoted to Greek literature,
may keep you from returning. But, if you
would prove yourself a good man and true, find your
way back to us by the date you promised. You can

<p class='c007'>You say you are longing for a line of some sort

everything described as in a diary, but I suppose it
was never delivered, as you don’t seem to have
stopped long in Epirus. Besides my letters are
generally not of a kind that I like to give to anyone,
unless I can be sure he will deliver them to you.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now I will tell you the news of the town. On
the 4th of July Sufenas and Cato were acquitted,
Procilius condemned. That shows us that our lights
of the law care not a straw for bribery, elections, a
political deadlock, treason or the country in general.
They prefer one not to murder a father of a family in
his own home; but even that preference has no overwhelming
majority in its favour: for 22 voted for
acquittal against 28 for condemnation. Publius no
doubt had awakened the sympathy of the jury by
his eloquent peroration for the prosecution. Hortalus

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>a word: for my little girl, who is ill, was afraid I
might offend Publius. After all this the people of
Reate took me to their “banks and braes” to plead
their cause against the Interamnates before the consul
and ten commissioners, because the Veline lake,
drained by the channel cut by M’. Curius through
the mountain,<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c012'><sup>[147]</sup></a> flowed into the Nar. By this means
the famous Rosia has been dried up, though it is still
moderately damp. I stayed with Axius, who took me
for a visit to the Seven Waters too.</p>

<p class='c007'>For Fonteius’ sake I returned to Rome on the 9th
of July. I went to the theatre and was greeted with
loud and unbroken applause—but don’t bother about
that: I am a fool to mention it. Then I gave my
attention to Antiphon. He was granted his freedom
before he appeared: and, not to keep you in suspense,
he won his laurels. But there never was such a
little weakling with so little voice and so.... But
keep that to yourself. However in the Andromache
he was taller than Astyanax: among the rest there
was no one of his size. You want to know next
about Arbuscula: she pleased me very much. The
games were magnificent and much liked. The wild
beast hunt was put off till later.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now follow me to the election field. There is an
outburst of bribery. More by token, the rate of
interest has risen from 4 per cent to 8 per cent since
the 15th of July. You will say: “Well, I can put up
with that at any rate.” And you call yourself a man
and a patriot! Memmius is supported by all Caesar’s
influence. The consuls have coupled him with Domitius
in an agreement which I dare not commit to
paper. Pompey is raging and growling and backing</p>

than one can say. None of them is romping ahead:
money levels all their ranks. Messalla is not in the
running, not that his heart or his friends have failed
him, but the coalition of the consuls and Pompey are
both against him. I think the elections will have to
be postponed. The candidates for the tribunate have
taken an oath to submit their conduct to Cato’s
approval, and have deposited £4,400<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c012'><sup>[149]</sup></a> with him on
the condition that any one of them who is condemned
by Cato shall lose it and it shall be given to
his rivals.</p>

<p class='c007'>I am writing this the day before the elections are
expected to come off. But on the 28th I will give you
a full account of them, if they have taken place and
the messenger has not started. If they really are
conducted without bribery, which people think will
be the case, then Cato alone will have done more than
all the laws and all the law courts can do. I am acting
for Messius, who has been recalled from his office.
Appius had given him a commission on Caesar’s staff:
but Servilius issued a warrant requiring his presence.
The tribes he has to face are the Pomptine, Veline
and Maecian. It is a sharp struggle, however it is
getting on fairly well. Then I have to get ready for
Drusus and after that for Scaurus. These will make
grand titles for my speeches. I may even have the
names of the consuls elect to add to the list; and, if
Scaurus is not one of them, he will find himself in
serious difficulties in this trial.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bare fact that my letter is by the hand of an
amanuensis will show you how busy I am. I have
nothing to grumble about as regards the frequency
of your letters, but most of them merely told me
where you were. That they were from you
showed, too, that you were well. The two of this

dated almost simultaneously from Buthrotum: for I
was anxious to know whether you had a good crossing.
But it is more the regularity of this constant
supply of letters which has pleased me than the
richness of their contents. The one that your guest
M. Paccius delivered was of importance and full of

senem, quoad primus ille sermo habetur, adest
in disputando senex, deinde, cum ipse quoque commodissime
locutus esset, ad rem divinam dicit se velle
discedere neque postea revertitur. Credo Platonem
vix putasse satis consonum fore, si hominem id aetatis
in tam longo sermone diutius retinuisset. Multo ego
magis hoc mihi cavendum putavi in Scaevola, qui et
aetate et valetudine erat ea, qua eum esse meministi,
et iis honoribus, ut vix satis decorum videretur eum
plures dies esse in Crassi Tusculano. Et erat primi
libri sermo non alienus a Scaevolae studiis, reliqui
libri <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τεχνολογίαν</span> habent, ut scis. Huic ioculatorem

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>have put the discussion in the mouths of Africanus,
Philus, Laelius and Manilius, adding the youths Q. Tubero,
P. Rutilius and the two sons-in-law of Laelius,
Scaevola and Fannius. So I am thinking of contriving
some way of mentioning him appropriately—for that I
think is what you want—in one of the introductions.
I am giving an introduction to each book, as Aristotle
does in the work he called the <em>Exoterics</em>. And I only
hope I may manage to get him in. For as you fully
comprehend, I have set my hand to a subject of wide
range and of some difficulty, which requires much
leisure; and that is precisely what I have not got.</p>

<p class='c007'>While praising those books, you miss the character
of Scaevola from the scene. It was not without good
reason that I removed him. Our god Plato did the
same in his <em>Republic</em>. When Socrates called on that
wealthy and cheery old soul Cephalus in the Piraeus,
the old man takes part in the discussion during the
introductory conversation; but after a very neat
speech, he pleads that he wants to go to a divine
service, and does not come back again. I fancy
Plato thought it would have been inartistic to keep
a man of that age any longer in so lengthy a discussion.
I thought there was still more reason to be
careful in the case of Scaevola, who was at the age
and in the state of health in which you must remember
he was, and was crowned with such honours
that it would hardly have been proper for him to
spend several days with Crassus at his villa at Tusculum.
Besides, the talk in the first book was not
unconnected with Scaevola’s pursuits: while the
remaining books contained a technical discussion, as
you know. In such I did not like the merry old
man, you remember, to take a part.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>In Pilia’s business I will be sure to do what you
suggest: for, as you say, the point is quite clear on
Aurelianus’ evidence. And it will give me a chance
of glorifying myself in my Tullia’s eyes. I am supporting
Vestorius: for I see you regard it as a favour,
and I make him see it too. But you know the kind of
man he is: frightfully difficult to get on with, even
for two such easy-going people.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now for your questions about C. Cato. You know
he was acquitted under the Junian and Licinian
law. The Fufian law will acquit him too, I assure
you, and that as much to the relief of his accusers as
of his supporters. However, he has made his peace
with Milo and myself. Drusus is being prosecuted
by Lucretius. The day for challenging the jury is
fixed for the 3rd of July. About Procilius there are
sinister rumours: but you know what juries are.
Hirrus is on good terms with Domitius. The decree
which these consuls have carried about the provinces,
“whosoever henceforth,” etc., I do not think will
have any effect.</p>

<p class='c007'>I don’t know what to say to your question about
Messalla: I have never seen candidates more evenly
matched. You know Messalla’s support. Scaurus
has been called into court by Triarius; without any
great sympathy for him being aroused, if you want to
know. However his aedileship recalls no unpleasant
memories, and their remembrance of his father has
some weight with the country voters. The other
two plebeian candidates are about equal, as Domitius
is strong in friends and his very popular gladiatorial
exhibition will count for him too, while Memmius is
popular with Caesar’s soldiers and relies on the support
of Pompey’s Gaul. If that does not avail him,</p>

were present at the carrying of a <em>lex curiata</em>—which
had never been passed; and two ex-consuls who
would depose to having been present at the drafting
of a decree for the fitting out of the consular provinces—though
there had never been any meeting of the
Senate about it at all. As this compact was alleged
not to be a mere verbal compact, but one properly
drawn up with the sums promised on it, drafts on the
bank, and many other documents, Memmius exhibited
it, with all the items entered,<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c012'><sup>[155]</sup></a> on the suggestion
of Pompey. It was all the same to Appius: he had
nothing to lose by it. The other has had a sad comedown,
and I may say is quite done for. Memmius, however,
having dissolved the coalition against Calvinus’
will, has sunk out of mind, and his ruin is all the more
irretrievable because we know now that his disclosure
annoyed Caesar very much. Our friend Messalla and
his fellow-competitor Domitius were very liberal to
the people, and could not be more popular. They are
certain of election. But the Senate has decreed that a
trial with closed doors should be held before the elections,
and each candidate’s conduct inquired into by
the panels chosen by lot for all of them. The candidates
are in a great fright: but some of the jury—among</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>them Opimus, Veiento, and Rantius—have appealed
to the tribunes to prevent their being called upon to
serve without the sanction of the people. The affair is
going on. A senatorial decree postponed the elections
until an enactment about the trial with closed
doors was carried. The day for that enactment came,
and Terentius vetoed it. The consuls, who were
taking the matter very coolly, referred the point to
the Senate. Thereupon there was Bedlam, and I
contributed my share of noise. You will say: “Can
you never hold your tongue?” Forgive me: I hardly
can. But could anything be more ridiculous? The
Senate had passed a decree that the elections should
not be held before that enactment was passed: if it
was vetoed, then the matter should be brought forward
again. The law was brought forward casually;
it was vetoed to the satisfaction of the proposers;
the matter was referred to the Senate: and they
decided that it was to the interest of the State that
the elections should be held as soon as possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>Scaurus, who was acquitted in the last few days,
after a most elaborate speech from me in his defence,
gave the requisite donations to the people tribe by
tribe at his own house, since all the days up to the
last of September, on which I am writing, had been
rendered impossible for the elections by ill omens
announced by Scaevola. But though his liberality
exceeded theirs, those who came first won the most
popularity. I should like to see your face as you read
this. For of course you have no hope that the business
will be protracted over many weeks. But there
is going to be a meeting of the Senate on the first
of October, to-day, for the day is already breaking.

<p class='c007'>What else do you want to know? Oh! the trials,
I suppose. Drusus and Scaurus are thought to be
innocent. Three candidates will probably be prosecuted,
Domitius by Memmius, Messalla by Q. Pompeius
Rufus, Scaurus by Triarius or L. Caesar. What
shall I be able to find to say for them, you will ask.
May I die, if I know. Certainly I find no suggestions
in those three books you praise so highly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here is the other news. From my brother’s letters
I hear that Caesar shows signs of extraordinary
affection for me, and this is confirmed by a very cordial
letter from Caesar himself. The result of the
war in Britain is looked forward to with anxiety. For
it is proved that the approach to the island is guarded
with astonishing masses of rock, and it has been
ascertained too that there is not a scrap of silver in
the island, nor any hope of booty except from slaves;
but I don’t fancy you will find any with literary or
musical talents among them.</p>

and glory than anything. And so we friends of

nothing of spending half a million of money<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c012'><sup>[157]</sup></a> for that

of L. Lentulus, the younger, who is being universally
accused of collusion—was incredibly infantile: Pompey
exerted his influence energetically: and the jury were
a rotten lot. Still 32 voted for condemnation and 38
for acquittal. Other trials are hanging over his head:
he is not out of the wood yet. You will say: “How

There is in fact no Republic to give one a feeling of
joy and peace. “And is that what you find so comfortable?”
you may ask. That is the very thing.
For I remember its glory during the little while when
I directed it, and the return that was paid me. It
does not cost me a pang to see one man omnipotent:
but those who were annoyed at my small power are
bursting with indignation. There are many things
which bring consolation to me without my stirring
from my original position; and I am returning to the
life which suits my nature best, to literature and my
studies. For the labour of pleading I console myself
by my delight in oratory. I find pleasure in my town
house and my country houses. I think not of the
height from which I have fallen, but of the depths
from which I have risen. If I have but my brother
and you with me, they may be hanged drawn and
quartered for all I care: I can study philosophy with
you. That part of my soul which used to harbour
wrath has lost its power of feeling. Now only my
private and personal affairs interest me. You will
find me in a wonderfully peaceful state of mind, and
upon my word your return is a great factor in my
peace: for there is no one in the world whose spirit
so harmonizes with my own.</p>

<p class='c007'>But now I will tell you the other news. Things
are drifting towards an interregnum: and a dictatorship
is in the air. There is a great deal of talk about
it, which helped Gabinius with timid jurors. All the
candidates for the consulship are accused of bribery.
Gabinius is with them too. P. Sulla applied for the
prosecution of him, suspecting that he would be too
out of pocket to bribe a jury. Torquatus applied too</p>

<p class='c007'>Any other news? Yes. An hour after the acquittal
of Gabinius another jury in indignation condemned
some one called Antiochus Gabinius, out of Sopolis’
studio, a freedman and attendant of Gabinius, under
the Papian law. He at once said “So the State will
not acquit me of treason as it did you.”<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c012'><sup>[159]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Pomptinus wants to celebrate his triumph on the
2nd of November. He is openly opposed by the
praetors Cato and Servilius and the tribune Q. Mucius,
who declare that no authority was ever given for a
triumph: and it certainly was given in the most
absurd manner. However Pomptinus will have the
consul Appius on his side. Cato declares he shall
never triumph as long as he lives. I fancy it will all
come to nothing like most similar affairs. Appius is
thinking of going to Cilicia without authority and at
his own expense.</p>

deadlock and the general licence. Observe my placidity
and praise my contempt for the Seleucinian
province,<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c012'><sup>[164]</sup></a> and my really delightful association with

<p class='c007'>Yes, I did see your feelings when we parted, and
to my own I can testify.  That is an additional
reason why you should take care that no new decrees
are passed, to prevent this painful separation from
lasting more than one year.  You have taken the
right steps with Annius Saturninus.  As to the
guarantee, please give it yourself, while you are in
town.  There are some proofs of ownership, for
instance those for Mennius’ or rather Atilius’ estate.
You have done exactly what I wanted in Oppius’
case, especially in putting the £7,000<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c012'><sup>[165]</sup></a> to his credit.
I must have that paid off without waiting till I’ve

<p class='c007'>Now I come to the line you wrote crosswise at the
end of your letter, in which you give me a word of
advice about your sister. The facts of the case are that
when I reached Arpinum and my brother had come,
the first thing we did was to have a long talk about you.
After that I brought the talk round to the discussion
you and I had about your sister at Tusculum. My brother’s
behaviour then to your sister was gentleness and
kindness itself. If there ever was any quarrel about</p>

in Arcano Quintus maneret, dies fecit, ego Aquini,
sed prandimus in Arcano. Nosti hunc fundum. Quo ut
venimus, humanissime Quintus “Pomponia” inquit,
“tu invita mulieres, ego arcivero viros.” Nihil potuit,
mihi quidem ut visum est, dulcius idque cum verbis
tum etiam animo ac vultu. At illa audientibus nobis
“Ego ipsa sum” inquit “hic hospita,” id autem ex eo,
ut opinor, quod antecesserat Statius, ut prandium
nobis videret. Tum Quintus “En” inquit mihi “haec
ego patior cotidie.” Dices: “Quid, quaeso, istuc erat?”
Magnum; itaque me ipsum commoverat; sic absurde
et aspere verbis vultuque responderat. Dissimulavi
dolens. Discubuimus omnes praeter illam, cui tamen
Quintus de mensa misit. Illa reiecit. Quid multa?
nihil meo fratre lenius, nihil asperius tua sorore mihi
visum est; et multa praetereo, quae tum mihi maiori
stomacho quam ipsi Quinto fuerunt. Ego inde Aquinum.
Quintus in Arcano remansit et Aquinum ad
me postridie mane venit mihique narravit nee secum
illam dormire voluisse et, cum discessura esset, fuisse
eius modi, qualem ego vidissem. Quid quaeris? vel
ipsi hoc dicas licet, humanitatem ei meo iudicio illo
die defuisse.</p>

fuit, ut videres tuas quoque esse partes instituendi et

<div class='english-page'>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>expense, there were no signs of it. So passed that
day. On the next day we started from Arpinum.
A festival caused Quintus to stop at Arcanum, while
I went on to Aquinum: but we lunched together at
Arcanum. You know his place there. Well, when
we reached it, Quintus said most politely, “Pomponia,
you invite the ladies, I will ask the men.” Nothing,
so far as I could see, could have been more gentle
than his words or his intention or his expression.
But before us all she answered “I’m only a stranger
here”; just because Statius had been sent on in
front to get dinner ready for us, I suppose. Says
Quintus to me: “There you are. That’s what I
have to put up with every day.” You may say there
surely was not much in that. But there was a good
deal: indeed she upset me myself; she answered
with such uncalled for acrimony in word and look.
I concealed my annoyance. We all took our places
except her: but Quintus sent her something from the
table, which she refused. In a word, it seemed to
me that my brother was as good-tempered and your
sister as cross as could be, and I have omitted a lot
of things that aroused my wrath more than Quintus’.
Then I went on to Aquinum. Quintus stayed at
Arcanum, and came to me the next morning, and
told me that she would not sleep with him and, when
she was leaving, she was as cross as when I saw her. In
fact, I don’t care if you tell her herself, that to my
mind she behaved with a lack of courtesy that day.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have said perhaps more than necessary about it
to show you that it is your turn to do a little instructing
and advising too. It only remains for you to
fulfil all my commissions before you start, and send
me an account of all of them, to rout Pomptinus out,</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 10th of May, the date of this letter, I set
out from my villa at Pompeii, to spend the day with
Pontius in his villa at Trebula. Thereafter I mean to
do my day’s journey regularly without delay. While
I was in my villa at Cumae, our friend Hortensius
paid me a very welcome visit. He asked if I had
any commissions, and I gave him commissions in
general, and in particular to prevent to the best of
his ability extension of my term of office in my province.
Please keep him up to it, and tell him that
I was much gratified at his visit, and at his promises
on that particular point and of any other assistance
I might need. I have bound our friend Furnius,
who, I see, will be tribune next year, to help
me in the same matter. My villa at Cumae was a
miniature Rome; there were such a lot of people in
the neighbourhood. In the middle of it all our friend
Rufio, seeing that Vestorius was on his tracks, baffled
the man by a ruse; for he did not come to me. You
may be surprised that he did not come, seeing that
Hortensius came, who is ill, lives afar off and is a
great man, and crowds of other people came as well.
I repeat he did not come. You may infer I did not
see him. How could I fail to see him when I travelled</p>

persuaded, and, as you add, there is not a pin to
choose between them. For myself I am reasonable;
but you will be away, and will any account be taken
of me in my absence? For, if either of us were on
the spot, a good face might be put on the matter
with Servius through the agency of Servilia. Now,
even if it were a thing I favoured, I see no way of
bringing it to pass.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now I come to that letter which I received from
Tullius. You have been very energetic about Marcellus:
so, if a decree should be passed, please inform
me: but, if not, try to carry the matter through: a
grant ought to be made to me and to Bibulus. But
I am confident that the decree will be passed especially
as it saves the people’s pocket. That is fine
about Torquatus. As for Maso and Ligur, we can
wait till they come. As to Chaerippus’ request, since
you have given me no tip on the matter——hang
the province! Must I trouble about him too? Well,
I must take enough trouble to prevent any debate on
the matter or count out in the House. As for
others——however you do well to have spoken
with Scrofa. As to Pomptinus you are right. It
comes to this, if Pomptinus will be at Brundisium
before June, M. Anneius and L. Tullius need not
hurry out of Rome. As to your news from Sicinius,
I am satisfied, provided this restriction does not apply
to anyone who has obliged me. But I will think it
over, as the plan pleases me. I will let you know</p>

saying that my friend Milo writes complaining of ill-treatment
from me, for allowing Philotimus to have
a hand in the purchase of his property. I acted on
the advice of C. Duronius, a man whom I saw to be
most friendly to Milo, and just such a person as you
suppose him to be. His plan and mine was this,
firstly, to keep a hold over Milo’s property for fear
some hard bargainer, a stranger to us, should rob him
of his slaves, of whom a great number were with
him; and secondly, that the settlement he intended
to make on Fausta should be respected. There was
the further intention, that we ourselves should have
the readiest means of saving anything that could be
saved. Now please review the whole matter, for
letters to me often exaggerate. If Milo complains
and writes to his friends, and, if Fausta wishes, as I
told Philotimus and as he agreed, I would not have
him purchase the property against Milo’s wish.
Nothing would compensate for offending Milo. You
will judge if the matter has been exaggerated.
Please consult Duronius. I have written also to
Camillus and to Lamia, among other reasons because
I do not feel sure you are in town. To sum up, in
deciding be careful of my honour, reputation and
interests.</p>

you; but perhaps you prefer to have news about myself.
So far no public body or private person has spent
money on me or on my staff. I have not even taken
the barest necessities allowed by the law of Julius,
nor have I billeted myself on anyone. My staff have
made up their minds that they must uphold my good
name. So far everything has gone well: the Greeks
have noted it and are full of outspoken praise. For
the rest I am endeavouring to act as I know you would
like. But let us reserve our praise for the end of the
story. In other respects I often blame my mistake

long for town, how hard I find it to bear the stupidity

<p class='c007'>Marcellus acted disgracefully over the man from
Comum:<a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c012'><sup>[177]</sup></a> even if he had not been a magistrate, still he
was a Transpadane. So Marcellus’ action seems to
me as likely to anger Pompey as Caesar; but that
is his own look-out. I agree with Varro’s statement,
which you quote in your letter, that Pompey will
surely go to Spain. I by no means approve of the
policy, and indeed I convinced Theophanes easily
that Pompey’s presence in Rome was the very best
course. So the Greek will put pressure on Pompey;
and his opinion weighs with him a great deal.</p>

<p class='c007'>I despatch this letter on the 6th of July, being
about to leave Athens, where I have stayed just ten
days. Pomptinus has come along with Cn. Volusius.
My quaestor is here. Your friend Tullius is the one
absentee. I have some open boats of Rhodes and
two-deckers from Mitylene and a few despatch boats.
There is no news of the Parthians. For the rest,
God help us.</p>

great admiration, and I have no fault at all to find

I hope I am making headway. But I have looked

one year only. So fight for me, for fear extension
of office might spoil my conduct.</p>

Prefects have exemption from serving on a jury.
Give the office to whom you will. I shall not be so

fond of Xeno as you are, and I am sure he knows
it. I have put you in well-deserved favour with
Patro and the other blockheads. Ister has told me
you have written to him that you learned from
Patro’s letter I was taking an interest in the point,
much to his delight. But when Patro urged me
to ask your Areopagus to cancel the minute they
had made when Polycharmus was praetor, it seemed
better to Xeno and afterwards to Patro himself that I
should send a letter to Memmius, who had set out to
Mitylenae the day before I arrived at Athens, asking
him to inform his agents that the minute could be
cancelled with his free consent. For Xeno was
sure the Areopagus would refuse to act against his
will. Memmius had abandoned his plan of building
a house; but he was angry with Patro. I enclose a
copy of the careful letter I wrote him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Please convey my condolences to Pilia. I will
tell you a secret you are not to repeat to her: I received

<p class='c007'>A sea voyage is a big business, especially in the
month of July.  Six days after leaving Athens I
came to Delos. On the 6th of July I got from the
Piraeus to Zoster with a contrary wind which kept
us there on the 7th. On the 8th we reached Ceos
in fine weather. From there we came to Gyaros, with
a wind strong, but not contrary: thence to Syros, and
from Syros to Delos; in both cases sailing quicker
than we could have wished. You know by this
time what the open boats of Rhodes are like, poor
things in a rough sea. So I have made up my mind
not to hurry and not to stir from Delos until I see
“all the peaks of Gyrae” clear.</p>

Gyaros as soon as I heard, and another on my own

gossip about the verdict and about the political

not pay the poll-tax: they were forced to sell out
their investments: groans and lamentations in the
towns, and awful conduct of one who is some
kind of savage beast rather than a man.  All the
people are, as you may suppose, tired of life.  However,
the poor towns are relieved that they have
had to spend nothing on me, my legates, or a
quaestor, or anyone.  For you must know that I not
only refused to accept pay, or what is a proper
perquisite under the Julian law, but that none of us
will take firewood or anything beyond four beds and
a roof; and in many places we do not accept even a
roof, but remain mostly under canvas. So extraordinary</p>

<p class='c007'>On the morning of the 17th of December the
Pindenissitae surrendered to me, on the fifty-seventh
day from the commencement of my siege. “The
Pindenissitae!” you will exclaim, “Who the deuce

fault. Could I turn Cilicia into Aetolia or Macedonia?
Take this for granted that with my army
and in my position such a big business was impossible.
Here is a synopsis of the affair. You agreed
to that in your last letter. You are aware of my
arrival at Ephesus, for you have congratulated me on
the reception I got on the day of arrival, which
delighted me beyond words. Thence, after a marvellous
welcome in the towns on my way, I reached
Laodicea on the 31st of July. I stayed there two days
in great state and with nattering speeches took the
sting out of all past injuries. I did the same at Colossae
and during a stay of five days at Apamea, three
at Synnada, five at Philomelus and ten at Iconium.
Nothing could be more fair, lenient or dignified than
my legal decisions. From there I came to camp on
the 24th of August. On the 28th I reviewed the
army at Iconium. On receipt of grave news about
the Parthians I left camp for Cilicia travelling through
that part of Cappadocia which borders on Cilicia,
intending that the Armenian Artavasdes and the
Parthians themselves should realize they were cut
off from entering Cappadocia. After camping five</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>days at Cybistra in Cappadocia, I got information
that the Parthians were far distant from that entrance
into Cappadocia, and rather were threatening Cilicia.
So I made a forced march into Cilicia by the gates of
Taurus. I reached Tarsus on the 5th of October.
Thence I hurried to Amanus, which divides Syria
from Cilicia by its watershed, a mountain that has
always been full of our enemies. Here on the 13th
of October we cut up a large body of the enemy. I
captured some strongly fortified posts by a night
assault of Pomptinus and a day assault of my own:
and we burned them. I was hailed as “General.”
For a few days I pitched camp at the very spot near
Issus, where Alexander had camped against Darius.
He was rather a better general than you or I. We
plundered and devastated Amanus, and after a stay
of five days took our departure. Meantime (for you
know there are such words as “panic” and “the uncertainties
of war”) report of my arrival gave
heart to Cassius, who was shut up in Antioch, and it
inspired fear in the Parthians. So, as the Parthians
retreated from the town, Cassius pursued them and
scored a success. In their retreat one of their leaders,
Osaces, a man of high rank, was wounded and died
a few days afterwards. I was in high favour in Syria.
Meantime Bibulus came. I fancy he wanted to be
my peer in the matter of that empty title. On
this same mountain Amanus he begins his task of
looking for a needle in a bottle of hay.<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c012'><sup>[188]</sup></a> But the

you my exile has been worth while, for I did not

Meantime I have made a <em>coup</em> in this: it is thanks to
me that Ariobarzanes lives and reigns a king. In

<p class='c007'>I am very glad that you have reached Epirus
safely, and that you report a voyage to your liking.
But I am rather upset that you are absent from
Rome at a moment so critical for me. However I
have one consolation: I hope you will have a pleasant
winter where you are and a nice rest. You ask me
the purport of a letter that C. Cassius, the brother
of Q. Cassius, your friend, sent me. The letter he
wrote is more modest than a subsequent epistle in
which he claimed to have ended the Parthian war.
The Parthians to be sure had retired from Antioch
before the arrival of Bibulus: but it was not thanks
to any <em>coup de main</em> of our troops. To-day the enemy
is wintering in Cyrrhestica and a serious war is imminent:
for the son of Orodes the king of the Parthians
is in a Roman province, and Deiotarus, to
whose son the daughter of Artavasdes is betrothed,
a very competent authority, is positive that the king
himself will cross the Euphrates with all his forces in
the early summer. On the very day on which Cassius’
despatch, dated the 7th of October, announcing victory
was read in the Senate, came mine announcing
trouble. My friend Axius says that Cassius’ despatch
gained no belief and mine was considered worthy of
attention. Bibulus’ despatch had not yet arrived:
but I know for a fact that it will express alarm.</p>

respect to Caesar’s demands, refusing to let Pompey
quit Rome, when revolution is imminent. Until
this trouble is unravelled, it may decline to allow me
to leave the province before my successor comes, and
not be willing to entrust such important provinces in
troublous times to legates. So I shudder to think
that the term of my office may be extended without
even any tribune being able to veto it; and the more
so on account of your absence, when you might interfere
in many cases with your advice, influence and
efforts. You will say I am raising imaginary alarms. I
am forced to hope that my alarms may be idle, but
everything frightens me. Though your letter written
at Buthrotum in sickness had a charming <em>finale</em>. “As
I see and hope, there will be nothing to hinder your
departure,” still I should prefer the phrase “as I see”
and there was no need for the words “and hope.” I
have received a letter dated just after the triumph of
Lentulus, which was brought post haste to Iconium by
the tax-farmers’ messengers. In it you repeat that
bitter-sweet saying, that there will be no delay, with
a postscript, that, if anything goes wrong, you yourself
will come to me. I am tortured by the doubts
you express: and you may see which of your letters I
have received, for I have not got the letter which you
say was handed to Hermo the centurion’s orderly. You
have repeatedly told me you entrusted a letter to
the slaves of Laenius. That letter, which was dated
the 21st of September, was handed to me at last by
Laenius on my arrival at Laodicea on the 11th of

thought it would be impracticable. But in future give
a direct “no” to any undesirable requests. Firm
fixed in my own determination and fired by the
weight of your opinion, I have overcome everybody
as you will find by my justice, self-abnegation and
easy courtesy. People were never more astonished
than to learn that not a farthing has been spent during
my tenure of office, either on public objects or
on any of my staff, except on my legate L. Tullius.
He has behaved well on the whole, but under the
Julian law on one occasion <em>en passage</em> and for the
day’s needs, and not as others would at every
hamlet, he did take something. He is the sole
offender; and forces me to add a rider to my remark

him no one has taken a penny. That blot I owe to

the inhabitants cannot be summoned to a court

on the fifth of January. I cannot describe how the
cities in Cilicia and especially the people of Tarsus
looked up to me. After crossing the Taurus, I found
Asia, that is so far as my district extends, very keen
to welcome me. For during the six months of my

season had been devoted every year to the pursuit
of gain. The richer states used to pay large sums to
escape from having soldiers billeted on them for the
winter. The people of Cyprus used to pay nearly
£50,000,<a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c012'><sup>[196]</sup></a> while under my administration, in literal
truth, not a penny will be demanded. I will take
no honours except speechifying in return for these
kindnesses which have so amazed people. I allow
neither statues, nor shrines, nor sculptured chariots:
and I don’t annoy the states in any other respects—but
perhaps I may annoy you by my egotism. Bear
with it from your regard for me. It was you who
wished me to act as I have. My tour through
Asia was such that even the crowning misery of
famine, which existed in my province owing to the
failure of the crops, gave me a welcome opportunity.
Wherever I went, without force, without legal process,
without hard words, by my personal influence
and exhortations, I induced Greeks and Roman
citizens, who had stored corn, to promise a large
quantity to the communities. On the 13th of February,
the date on which I despatch this letter, I
have arranged to try cases from Cibyra and Apamea
at Laodicea; from the 15th of March, from Synnada,
Pamphylia (when I will look out for a horn for Phemius),
Lycaonia and Isaurum at the same place.
After the 15th of May, I set out to spend June
in Cilicia: I hope without being troubled by the
Parthians. July, if things turn out as I hope, is to
be spent on my journey back through the province.

<p class='c007'>Those are my plans. Now let me tell you about
Brutus. Among his intimates your friend Brutus has
some creditors of the people of Salamis in Cyprus,
M. Scaptius and P. Matinius, whom he recommended
to me warmly. Matinius I have not met: Scaptius
came to see me in camp. For the sake of Brutus I
promised that the people of Salamis should settle
their debts to him. The fellow thanked me, and
asked for the post of prefect. I informed him I
always refused business men, as I have told you.
This rule Cn. Pompeius accepted when he made a
similar request. So did Torquatus, M. Laenius, and
many others. However, I told Scaptius that if
he wanted the post on account of his bond, I
would see that he got paid. He thanked me
and took his leave. Our friend Appius had given
him some squadrons to put pressure on the people
of Salamis, and had also given him the office of
prefect. He was causing trouble to the people of
Salamis. I gave orders that his cavalry should leave
the island. That annoyed him. In short, to keep
faith with him, I ordered the people, when they came
along with Scaptius to see me at Tarsus, to pay the
money. They had a good deal to say about the bond,
and about the harm that Scaptius had done them.
I refused to listen. I prayed and besought them to</p>

I had done their state. Finally, I threatened to compel
them. So far from refusing to settle, the people
said that really they would be paying out of my
pocket, in the sense that I had refused to take the
present usually given to the governor, which they admitted
would be more than the amount they owed
to Scaptius. I praised their attitude. “Very well,”
said Scaptius; “but let us reckon up the total.” Now
in my traditionary edict<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c012'><sup>[197]</sup></a> I had fixed the rate of
interest at 12 per cent compound interest, reckoned
by the year. But Scaptius demanded 48 per cent in
accordance with the terms of the bond. I declared
that I could not break the rule laid down in my edict.
But he produced a decree of the Senate, made in the
consulship of Lentulus and Philippus,<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c012'><sup>[198]</sup></a> ordering that
the governor of Cilicia should give judgement according
to the bond. At first I was horror stricken,
for it spelled ruin to the community. I find there
are two decrees of the Senate in the same year about
this identical bond. When the people of Salamis
wanted to raise a loan in town to pay off another,
they were obstructed by a law of Gabinius which forbade
lending to provincials. Then these intimates of
Brutus, depending on his support, professed willingness
to lend at 48 per cent, if they were protected by a
decree of the Senate. Brutus induced the Senate to
make a decree that the transaction between the people
of Salamis and the money-lenders should be exempted
from the provisions of the law. They paid down the
money. Afterwards it came into the heads of the</p>

Gabinius’ law forbade any legal process on the
bond. Then the Senate passed a decree that the bond
should be good at law, giving this bond the same
validity as other bonds and nothing more. When I
pointed this out, Scaptius took me aside. He said
that he had no objection to my ruling; but that the
people of Salamis imagined they owed him nearly
£50,000. That he wanted to get that sum, but
that they owed rather less. He begged me to induce
them to fix it at that amount. “Very well,” said I.
I sent Scaptius away, and summoned the people and
asked them the amount of the debt. They replied
something over £25,000. I consulted Scaptius again.
He was loud in his protests. I said that the only
plan was for them to check their accounts. They sat
down and made out the account. It agreed to a
penny with their statement. They wanted to pay, and
begged him to receive the money. Again Scaptius
led me aside, and asked me to let the matter stand
over. The request was impertinent, but I consented. I
would not listen to the complaints of the Greeks and
their demand to deposit the sum in the temple
treasury. The bystanders all declared that the conduct
of Scaptius was outrageous in refusing 12 per
cent with compound interest. Others said he was a
fool. He seemed to me to be more of a knave than
a fool: for either he was not content with 12 per
cent on good security, or he hoped for 48 per cent
on very doubtful security.</p>

of affection, kindness, and obliging zeal.  I will not
pay “gold for brass” (for that is what you ask for),
nor will I start an arrangement of my own, but will
keep to your order.  You say that the last letter
you got from me was from Cybistra dated the 21st
of September, and you want to know which of yours
I have received.  Almost all you mention except
those which you say were entrusted to Lentulus’
servants at Equotuticus and Brundisium.  So your
energy is not a dead loss as you fear, but has been
well spent, if you aimed at giving me pleasure.  For
nothing has ever given me more pleasure.</p>

reserve in the case of Appius and my generosity

feared you might not quite like it. For Appius on
his journey sent me two or three letters showing
pique, because I revoked some of his enactments.
It is as if a doctor, when a patient has been placed
under the care of another, should be angry with his
successor for changing his prescription. So Appius,

Sometimes he is angry, sometimes he thanks me;
for no act of mine has reflected on his policy. It is
only the difference of my <em>regime</em> that annoys him.
There is a very wide difference between a province
worn out by expense and losses under his rule and
not having to pay a penny out of private or public
purse under my administration. I need not mention
his prefects, his staff and his legates, the acts of
robbery, of rape and insult. But now, upon my
word, no private house is managed with such judgement
or such economy, or is so well ordered as my
whole province. Some friends of Appius put an
absurd construction on my policy and declare that I
am seeking popularity to damage him, and am acting
honourably, not for the sake of my own reputation, but
to cause him shame. However, if Appius, as the letter
from Brutus which you forward to me shows, expresses
his thanks, I am content: but the very day on which
I write this letter before dawn I am thinking of annulling
many of his wrong enactments and decisions.</p>

<p class='c007'>I come now to the matter of Brutus. On your
advice I zealously cultivated his friendship, I had
even begun to feel a real liking for him: but there
I pull myself up for fear I should vex you. For do
not imagine that there is anything I should prefer
better than to execute his commission, or anything
on which I have taken more pains. He gave me
a volume of commissions, and you spoke to me
about his affairs. I have done my best with all of
them; first of all I induced Ariobarzanes to pay him
the money he promised me. So long as his highness
was with me the business was on a good footing: but

for many reasons and because it is rumoured that he
will come to conduct the war against the Parthians.
Even to him however payment is made on the
following terms. On every thirtieth day some
£8,000 is paid and that by tribute imposed on the
king’s subjects. Even such a sum will not cover the
amount of monthly interest. However our friend
Gnaeus is an easy-going creditor. He is willing to
forgo his capital and is content with interest, and
that not in full. The king pays no one else and has
no means to pay. He has no treasury and no regular
tribute: he levies taxes on the method of Appius.
They are scarcely sufficient to pay the interest on
Pompey’s money. His highness has two or three
very wealthy friends, but they look after their own
pockets as well as you or I. Still I do not cease to
write dunning, coaxing and scolding his highness.
Deiotarus too has told me that he has sent messengers
to him about his debt to Brutus: and they came
back with the reply that he has no assets. I can
quite believe it, for I have never seen a kingdom
more plundered or a king more needy. So I am
thinking of resigning my guardianship, or, as Scaevola
did for Glabrio, of repudiating both capital and
interest. However I have conferred the office of
prefect, which I promised Brutus through you, on
M. Scaptius and L. Gavius, who are his agents in the
kingdom; for they were not conducting their business
in my province. You will remember that my
principle was that he might have as many offices of
prefect at his disposal as he liked, provided he did
not give them to business men: so I offered him</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>two others besides. But the gentlemen for whom he
asked them had left my province.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now to talk about the people of Salamis, a matter
which I see came as a surprise to you as it did to
me. Brutus never told me that that money was
his. Indeed I have his own memorandum stating
“The people of Salamis owe money to M. Scaptius
and P. Matinius, my friends.” He recommends these
gentlemen to me, and to spur me adds a postscript
that he has gone security to them for a large sum.
I had arranged that they should pay in compound
interest for six years at 12 percent. But Scaptius
demanded 48 per cent, I was afraid, if he got his
request, that you too would cease to be my friend,
for I should have departed from the terms of my own
edict, and have ruined utterly a state enjoying the
protection of Cato and Brutus himself and distinguished
by my attentions. At this very point Scaptius
thrusts a letter of Brutus into my hand, stating
what Brutus had never told me or you, that Brutus himself
was the party concerned, and asking me to give
the office of prefect to his agent. But that was the
very proviso I had authorized you to make, that no
office could be given to a business man, above all to
such a fellow as Scaptius. For he had been a prefect
of Appius, and indeed had had some squadrons of
cavalry, which he had used to beset the Senate at
Salamis in their own chamber, so that five Members
of the House died of starvation. Accordingly on the
day I reached the province, since an embassy from
Cyprus had already met me at Ephesus, I sent orders
that his cavalry should leave the island at once.
This, I fancy, had led Scaptius to write somewhat
bitterly about me to Brutus. However, my attitude</p>

rate in my edict, with the approval of the most

Laenius, and to Pompey himself in the case of Sex.

angry at the disbanding of his cavalry, well I shall
be sorry that he is angry with me, but I shall be far
sorrier at discovering he is not the man I imagined
he was. Scaptius will admit that he had the opportunity
of getting by my decision all the money
allowed by my edict. I will add a point which I

judgement that the payment of the people of
Salamis to Scaptius is good at law. The equity of this
course I will leave to your consideration. I will not
even appeal to Cato: but don’t think I have let slip your
exhortations. They are fixed in my heart. With tears
in your eyes, you told me to think of my reputation.
Is there any letter of yours which does not touch on
the topic? So let who will be angry. I can put up
with it. “The right is on my side,” especially since
I have bound myself to good conduct, with six volumes<a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c012'><sup>[204]</sup></a>
for bail. I am glad you like the books so much,
though there is one point of history which you question,
that about Cn. Flavius, the son of Annius. He
did not flourish before the days of the decemviri,
since he held a curule aedileship, which was instituted
long after their time. What good then did he do by
publishing the official calendar? It is thought that
at one time the calendar was not exposed in public,
so that a privileged few might be the sole source of
information as to days propitious for business. Moreover,
several authorities maintain that this Cn. Flavius
was the first man to publish the calendar and to draw
up a digest of the forms of legal procedure. So don’t
think that I, or rather my spokesman Africanus, invented
a fiction. You took my remark about the
actor’s mannerism, and suspected a satirical meaning:<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c012'><sup>[205]</sup></a>
but I wrote in all <em>naïveté</em>. You tell me that Philotimus
wrote to you about my being hailed imperator;

It is a great bother. However Deiotarus has decided
to join my camp in full force. He has thirty
squadrons of four hundred men each armed in our
fashion, and two thousand cavalry. He can hold
out till Pompey comes. A letter he writes to me

many details, among them in the stipulation which
the Greeks hold as the salvation of their freedom,
that Greek cases are to be settled according to Greek
law. The edict is short on account of the division I
have made, as I considered it fell better under two
heads. The one concerns provincial matters and
deals with town accounts, debt, the rate of interest,

with the rest of judicial procedure I left unwritten.
I stated that in such matters my decrees would be

far satisfy everybody. The Greeks are jubilant at

I pet them, indulge them, praise and honour them:

the rates of interest specified in their bonds were upheld
even by Servilius. My procedure is this. I name
a day fairly remote, before which, if the debtors pay
up, I lay down that I shall allow only 12 per cent.
But, if they have not paid, judgement will be according
to the bond. Accordingly the Greeks pay their
debts at a fair rate of interest, and the farmers are
gratified, provided they get their fill of compliments
and invitations. In short, they are all so intimate

Hercules of Polycles bears the inscription <span class='fss'>CENS.</span>: and
the pose, the dress, the ring and the likeness prove
that it is a statue of the same person. As a matter
of fact, when among the crowd of gilded knights
placed by Metellus on the Capitol, I noticed a likeness
of Africanus with the name Serapio on the
pedestal, I thought it was a workman’s error, but
now I see it is Metellus’ mistake. What gross ignorance
of history! For that misconception about
Flavius and the calendar, if it is such, is widely held:
and you were quite right in having doubts about it.
I have followed the view which is almost universal, as
Greek authors often do. Every one says that Eupolis,
the poet of the old Comedy, was thrown into the sea
by Alcibiades on his voyage to Sicily. Eratosthenes
confutes this, producing plays exhibited by him
after that date. But that is no reason for laughing
at Duris of Samos, who is an accurate historian,
because he follows a vulgar error. All historians
agree that Zaleucus drew up laws for the Locrians.
It is not therefore fatal to Theophrastus, if he is
called to account for that by your friend Timaeus.
But not to know that one’s great-grandfather was not
censor is shocking, especially as after his consulship
no Cornelius was censor during his lifetime.</p>

is there to say,” and follow it by a most affectionate
warning not to forget to be on the watch and to keep
an eye on events. Have you heard anything about
any of my staff? I am sure there has been no wrong-doing,
<em>pas du tout</em>. It could not have escaped my
notice, and it will not. But your earnest entreaty
seemed to hint something.</p>

<p class='c007'>As for M. Octavius, I repeat that your reply was
excellent. I could wish it had been in more positive
terms. For Caelius has sent me a freedman of his
and a carefully worded letter about panthers and an
offer from the townships to furnish contributions. I
replied that the second item is annoying, if my conduct
is still a secret and the news has not reached
town that in my province no money is exacted except
in satisfaction of debts: and I have told him that it
would be improper for me to allow payment and for
him to take it. I have a sincere regard for him and
have warned him that after his prosecution of other
people he should conduct himself on more careful lines.
As to the second point I have told him it would be
a blot on my escutcheon that the people of Cibyra
should have a public hunt during my governorship.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lepta leaps with joy over your letter: for it was
nicely written and puts me in his good graces. Your
tiny daughter has done me a favour in ordering you
earnestly to send me her greetings. It was kind of
Pilia and very dutiful of your daughter to send greetings
to one whom as yet she has never met. So please</p>

quotation, “ashamed to refuse, but yet afraid to
take.” I suppose you have heard of Curio’s idea to recall
Memmius. As for the debt due from Egnatius of

it will not lessen Caesar’s energy in building a palace
near the sacred grove of Diana. This bit of news
came to me from P. Vedius, a shady character, but
an intimate of Pompey. The fellow met me on the
road with two chariots, a carriage and horses and a
litter and a large following. If Curio carries his law,<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c012'><sup>[216]</sup></a>
he will have to pay £l apiece. Besides other things,
there was a dog-faced baboon in a chariot, and
some wild asses. I never met such a rascal. But listen
to the end of the story, At Laodicea Vedius put up
with Pompeius Vindullus, and left his belongings
with him, while he came to meet me. Meantime Vindullus
died, and his property is supposed to go to
Pompeius Magnus. C. Vennonius went to the house
and, while sealing all the goods, found Vedius’ baggage.
Among this baggage there were five little
busts of Roman married ladies, among them one of
the sister of your friend Brutus—a brute indeed to
be acquainted with the fellow—and one of the wife
of Lepidus, whose easy conduct agrees with the

at Laodicea and tells me that he is on the point of
sailing to join you: so I give him this letter in reply
to your letter which I got from Brutus’ letter-carrier.
First I will answer your last page which caused me
much concern:—that is about Cincius’ communication
on the talk he had with Statius. I was particularly
concerned at Statius’ remark that the plan
had my approval. Approval indeed! I need only
say thus much. I wish the ties of friendship to be
as many and close as possible between us, though
none can be so close as those of our common liking.
I am far from wanting the tie between us to be
relaxed. Quintus however to my knowledge will
often use bitter language on his private affairs, and
often I have pacified his anger, as I think you know.
On my late tour or military campaign I have seen
him often fly in a temper and often calm again. I
don’t know what he wrote to Statius; whatever he
meant to do, he ought not to have informed a freedman.
However I will do my best to prevent any
course contrary to our wishes and to propriety. In
a case like this it is not enough for a man to make
himself responsible for his own conduct only: and</p>

Is multis nominibus in Trophoniana Chaeronis

Cum mihi auctor placeret (etenim erat <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱστορικώτατος</span>

to the boy, or young man as he is now, Quintus.
This I am always telling him. To me he seems to
love his mother greatly, as he should, and to be
extremely fond of you. He is a lad of high but complex
character, and I have enough to do to guide
his conduct.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having devoted my first page to answering your
last, I will now return to your first. I relied on the
maps of Dicaearchus, a writer of no mean standing
and an authority you accept, for the information that
all the states of the Peloponnese bordered on the
sea. In the account of the cave of Trophonius,
which he puts into the mouth of Chaeron, he blames
the Greeks on many scores for sticking to the sea
coast; and he does not except a single district in
the Peloponnese. He was a very accurate historian
and lived in the Peloponnese, so that his evidence
seemed trustworthy. Still I was surprised and communicated
my doubts to Dionysius. Dionysius was
startled at first, but finally accepted his authority,
since he had as good an opinion of Dicaearchus as
you have of C. Vestorius or I of M. Cluvius.
Arcadia he agreed had a seaport Lepreon: but
Tenea, Aliphera and Tritia were, he considered, more
modern, a view he supported by the omission of
these places from Homer’s catalogue of the ships.
Accordingly I borrowed the passage from Dicaearchus
in so many words. I know that Phliasii is the proper
form. Please make it so in your copy. I read it in
mine. But first of all thinking of Phlious I was
misled by a vicious analogy of Opuntii from Opous
and Sipuntii from Sipous. But I altered it at once.</p>

In this very assize which I have been holding at
Laodicea from the 13th of February to the 1st of
May for all the districts except Cilicia, I have done
wonders. See how many states have been freed from
debt and how many have had their burden lightened.
All have revived on acquiring home rule, and using
their own enactments in law. I have given them
in two ways the chance of freeing themselves or
relieving themselves from debt. First by causing
them no expense during my administration (and in
saying no expense I mean literally not one farthing),
which has helped them astonishingly out of their
trouble. Secondly the states had suffered from
surprising corruption in their own countrymen, that is
to say their magistrates. I questioned the men who
had held the office of magistrate during the last ten
years. They concealed nothing. So without exposure
they took on their own backs the repayment
of the money: and the communities which had paid
the tax-farmers nothing for the present five years
have now without any complaints paid up arrears for
the last five years too. So I am the apple of their eye
to the tax-farmers. “Grateful fellows,” you exclaim.
Yes I have experienced their gratitude. The rest of
my judicial conduct has been enlightened, but mild
and marvellously courteous. There has been none
of the difficulty of access so characteristic of provincial
governors; and no backstairs jobbery. Before
daybreak I walk up and down in my house, as I did
of yore when a candidate for office. This is popular
and a great boon, and I have not felt it a burden
owing to my old training.</p>

could accomplish in my own province or attempt

measure with the king and still do so daily—by
letter. The king himself was in my company only
for three or four days and at a crisis in his affairs,
from which I released him. But both then in person
and subsequently in repeated letters I have continually
begged and besought him in my own name
and advised and persuaded him in his own interest.
My efforts have borne fruit: but how much at this
distance I cannot tell for certain. The people of
Salamis however, whom I could influence, I have
induced to consent to settle all their debt with
Scaptius, but with interest at 12 per cent calculated
from the date of the last contract, and not at
simple but compound interest. The money was counted
down: but Scaptius refused to take it. What kind of
a figure do you cut, who say that Brutus will make a
sacrifice? Forty-eight per cent was written in the bond.
It was an impossible sum. It could not be paid nor
could I have permitted it. I hear after all that</p>

<p class='c007'>inquit Ennius, ut equites Scaptio ad pecuniam cogendam

scribis morderi te interdum, quod non simul sis, paterere
me id facere, si vellem? “Non amplius,” inquis,
“quinquaginta.” Cum Spartaco minus multi primo
fuerunt. Quid tandem isti mali in tam tenera insula
non fecissent? Non fecissent autem? immo quid
ante adventum meum non fecerunt? Inclusum in
curia senatum habuerunt Salaminium ita multos dies,
ut interierint non nulli fame. Erat enim praefectus
Appi Scaptius et habebat turmas ab Appio. Id me
igitur tu, cuius mehercule os mihi ante oculos solet
versari, cum de aliquo officio ac laude cogito, tu me,
inquam, rogas, praefectus ut Scaptius sit? Alias hoc
statueramus, ut negotiatorem neminem, idque Bruto
probaramus. Habeat is turmas? Cur potius quam</p>

<div class='english-page'>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>Scaptius is sorry. As to his argument from a decree
of the Senate ordering judgement to be given according
to the bond, the reason for that was that in
borrowing the money the people of Salamis contravened
the law of Gabinius. Aulus’ law forbade that
judgement should be given for money so borrowed.
So the Senate decreed that judgement might be
given on that particular bond. Now the bond in
question has the same validity as other bonds, and no
special privilege. I fancy Brutus will admit that my
behaviour has been proper. I do not know if you
will take that view, but certainly Cato will.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now I come back to yourself. My dear friend, you
have praised the nice honour of my conduct “and
can you dare with your own mouth,” as Ennius says,
ask me to give Scaptius cavalry to collect his debts?
Or would you, if you were here,—you who say that
you chafe sometimes at not being with me,—would
you suffer me to do such a thing, if I wanted? “Not
more than fifty men,” you say. Spartacus had fewer
men than that at first. The blackguards would have
done indescribable damage in such a weak island.
Do you say, they would have refrained? Look at
the damage they did before I came here. They
kept the members of the local Senate prisoners in
their Chamber for so long that some died of hunger.
For Scaptius was a prefect of Appius, and was allowed
some cavalry. Your face is always before my eyes,
when I think of duty and honour, and can you, you,
I repeat, ask me to give the fellow the office of prefect?
I had settled in other cases never to give the office
to a man of business, a course which had won the approval
of Brutus: and is a fellow like Scaptius to
have cavalry? Why should he not be content with a</p>

inquit, “principes.” Scio; nam ad me Ephesum usque
venerunt flentesque equitum scelera et miserias suas
detulerunt. Itaque statim dedi litteras, ut ex Cypro
equites ante certam diem decederent, ob eamque
causam, tum ob ceteras Salaminii nos in caelum
decretis suis sustulerunt. Sed iam quid opus equitatu?
solvunt enim Salaminii; nisi forte id volumus

Et ego audebo legere umquam aut attingere eos

style. The leading people of Salamis insist,
he declares. Of course; that is why they came to me
and with tears told me of his men’s atrocities and
their own miseries. Accordingly I sent a letter at
once ordering the cavalry to quit Cyprus by a certain
day, and that, as well as other acts of mine, has
caused the people of Salamis to praise me to the
skies in their decrees. There is no need of cavalry
now, for the people are ready to pay,—unless perhaps
I want to use force to make them pay 48 per cent
interest. Were I to do such a thing, I could never
venture to read or touch those volumes which you
praise. You, my dear fellow, have had far too much
regard for Brutus in the matter. I perhaps not
enough. I have informed Brutus of the drift of
your letter. Now for the remaining topics.</p>

<p class='c007'>I am pleased to do all I can for Appius here consistently
with my honour. I do not dislike him and I
like Brutus: and Pompey, for whom I have a higher
regard every day, is surprisingly importunate. You
have heard that C. Caelius comes here as quaestor.
I don’t know why, but I don’t like that affair of
Pammenes. I hope to be at Athens in the month of
September. Please let me know the dates of your
travels. I understood the <em>naïveté</em> of Sempronius
Rufus from your letter written in Corcyra. I am
really quite jealous of the influence Of Vestorius.</p>

the crowd is pressing in and Philogenes is in a hurry.
Good-bye, give my greetings to Pilia, when you

from my son.</p>

officer of praetorian rank that I have: for Pomptinus,
who came out on that condition, has left me already
according to his agreement. My quaestor is notoriously
unsuitable; he is “unsteady, wanton and lightfingered.”
There is one objection to my brother’s

provincial life. Certes, it is a hateful bore. Then,
supposing he does not like to refuse, what is my proper
course? Seeing that a great war is likely in Syria,

justice—none so that he could dare complain—and a

difficult in the matter of handing over the province.
But some god will direct my course.</p>

<p class='c007'>ut saepe ad te scripsi, feci omnia. Cyprii numerabant;
sed Scaptius centesimis renovato in singulos
annos faenore contentus non fuit. Ariobarzanes non
in Pompeium prolixior per ipsum quam per me in
Brutum. Quem tamen ego praestare non poteram;
erat enim rex perpauper, aberamque ab eo ita longe,
ut nihil possem nisi litteris; quibus pugnare non
destiti. Summa haec est. Pro ratione pecuniae
liberalius est Brutus tractatus quam Pompeius. Bruto
curata hoc anno talenta circiter c, Pompeio in sex
mensibus promissa cc. Iam in Appi negotio quantum
tribuerim Bruto, dici vix potest. Quid est igitur,
quod laborem? Amicos habet meras nugas, Matinium,
Scaptium. Qui quia non habuit a me turmas
equitum, quibus Cyprum vexaret, ut ante me fecerat,
fortasse suscenset, aut quia praefectus non est, quod
ego nemini tribui negotiatori, non C. Vennonio,
meo familiari, non tuo, M. Laenio, et quod tibi Romae
ostenderam me servaturum; in quo perseveravi. Sed
quid poterit queri is, qui, auferre pecuniam cum
posset, noluit? Scaptio, qui in Cappadocia fuit,

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>done everything for your friend Brutus. The people of
Cyprus were paying down the money. Scaptius was not
content with 12 per cent compound interest. Ariobarzanes
is not more accommodating to Pompey for his
own sake than to Brutus for mine. Still I could not go
bail for him, for he is a very needy monarch and I was
such a long way off that I could only press him on paper,
as I did continually. The conclusion is this. In proportion
to the sum lent, Brutus has been treated more liberally
than Pompey: for Brutus there has been got this
year about £24,400. To Pompey has been promised
£48,800 within six months. In the business of Appius,
my concessions to Brutus are almost incalculable.
I have no reason to distress myself. Brutus’ friends are
men of straw, Matinius, and Scaptius, who is perhaps
angry because he could not get troops to harry Cyprus
as he had done before my time, or because he was not
made a prefect, an office I have not granted to any
man of business, not to C. Vennonius, my friend, nor
to your friend M. Laenius. I have persevered in the
course that I told you at Rome I should keep: but a
man who refused to take his money, when he could,
cannot grumble. The other Scaptius who was in
Cappadocia I think is satisfied. First of all he accepted
a military tribuneship from me, which a letter from
Brutus had persuaded me to offer him; but he wrote
me afterwards that he did not want to take it up.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a person Gavius, who, after I had offered
him a post as prefect at Brutus’ request, said and did
a good deal to disparage me. He is Clodius’ puppydog.
He did not condescend to be one of my escort
when I left Apamea, nor, when he came into camp
later and was leaving it, did he ask if I had any
commissions. For some unknown reason he was an</p>

creature I am. You know I will not brook discourtesy
from men of power, and should I put up
with it from this hanger-on? Though, to be sure,
gracious bestowal of honour is something more than
putting up with a man. So Gavius, when on his
road to Rome he saw me lately at Apamea, addressed
me as I should scarcely address Culleolus. “Where,”
said he, “am I to look for my pickings?” I answered
less sternly than those present thought proper, that I
was not accustomed to give pickings to men whose
services I had not used. He went off in a temper.
If Brutus listens to the talk of such a shady customer,
you may have him to yourself. I shall not
be your rival. But I think he will behave all
right. However I wanted you to know the circumstances,
and I have recounted the matter very fully

<p class='c007'>I came to Tarsus on the 5th of June. There I was
upset by many troubles: a big war in Syria, big cases
of robbery in Cilicia, my difficulty in arranging things,
considering there are only a few days left of my year of
office: but the hardest problem of all is that, according

a suitable person. Of Caelius I hear nothing. The
proper thing seems to be to leave my brother with
military power, but that involves many difficulties—our
separation, risk of war, mutiny in the troops,
a thousand other hazards. A hateful business altogether.
But fortune must look to it, since reason
serves our purpose little.</p>

<p class='c007'>You, having come safe to Rome, as I hope, will as
usual look to everything that concerns me, especially
the matter of my daughter, about whose marriage
settlement I have written to Terentia expressing my
intentions, since you were in Greece. Then please
look after my triumph. For as you were absent from
town, I fear the Senate hardly paid sufficient attention
to my despatch.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following point I will write to you in dark
phrases: your cleverness will scent my meaning. My
wife’s freedman (you know whom I mean) seemed

his accounts on the sale of the goods of the Crotonian
tyrannicide.<a id='r220' /><a href='#f220' class='c012'><sup>[220]</sup></a> I fear you have noticed something.
Look into this matter yourself alone, and secure

<p class='c007'>You must certainly be at Rome now. If you are,
I am glad of your safe arrival. So long as you were
away from town, you seemed to me to be further off
than if you were in Rome, for I heard less of my own
business and less of the business of the state. So
please send plenty of chatty letters on every kind of
subject to meet me, though I hope, when you read
this, I shall be well on my journey home. Above all
write me on the subject I raised in my former letter.
From the stuttering hesitation of my wife’s freedman
in our meetings and talks I infer that he has been
cooking his accounts a little in the matter of the sale
of the Crotonian’s<a id='r221' /><a href='#f221' class='c012'><sup>[221]</sup></a> goods. Investigate the matter
with your usual care, but pay still more attention to
this. When leaving the city of the seven hills he
tendered an account of debts of some £100 and £200<a id='r222' /><a href='#f222' class='c012'><sup>[222]</sup></a>
to Camillus, and put himself down as owing £100
from Milo’s goods and £200 from the property in the
Chersonese, and as having inherited two sums of
£2,600,<a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c012'><sup>[223]</sup></a> of which not a penny had been paid, though
all were due on the 1st of the second month. Milo’s
freedman, Timotheus, the namesake of Conon’s
father, he said, had never given a thought to the
matter. Now first try and secure the whole amount,
and secondly don’t overlook the interest from the
afore-mentioned day. All the time I had to endure
him, I was much upset. He came to me to spy out</p>

the matter as thoroughly as possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>Though I have nearly served my year (for only
thirty-three days remain), still I am greatly concerned
about my province. Syria is ablaze with war, and
Bibulus is burdened with its cares in the midst of
his own great sorrow,<a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c012'><sup>[225]</sup></a> and his legates, quaestor and
friends write to me to go to his aid: so, although
the army I have is weak—the auxiliaries certainly
are good, Galatians, Pisidians, Lycians, the main
strength of my force—I have thought it my duty to
keep an army facing the foe, so long as I am authorized
by the Senate’s decree to be in charge of my
province. But what pleases me greatly is that
Bibulus gives no trouble. He writes to me about
any other topic by preference, and the day of my
departure creeps on unnoticed. When it arrives,
there is the further problem of my substitute, unless
my quaestor Caldus comes, of whom so far I have no
news.</p>

suddenly I find myself father-in-law of Dolabella his
accuser.  You invoke heaven’s benison.  So say I,
and you I know are sincere. Believe me, it was the
last thing I had expected.  Indeed I had even sent
trusty agents to Terentia and Tullia about the suit of
Ti. Nero, who had made proposals to me: but they
arrived in town only when the betrothal was over.

porch for the Academy, when Appius has abandoned
his design of a porch at Eleusis? I am sure you are

it over to a boy? But ought I to hand it over to my
brother? The latter is prejudicial to my own interests.
My brother was the only man it would not be
an insult to prefer to the quaestor, especially as that
officer was of noble birth. Still, while the Parthians
seemed threatening, I determined to leave my brother
in charge, or even to run counter to the decree of the
Senate and for the sake of the Republic remain here
myself. Their marvellously opportune retirement removed
my doubts. I foresaw the world’s comment.
“So he has left his brother in charge! Is this holding
a province for one year only? And what about the
decree of the Senate that ex-governors should not be
eligible? Why, his brother was governor for three
years.” These are the arguments for the public; but
for you I have private reasons. I should have been
in constant anxiety as to some exhibition of temper
or overbearingness or negligence; for such things
will happen. Perhaps his son, a mere headstrong
lad, would have given me cause for distress: his
father would not send him away, and was annoyed
with you for saying that he ought. As for Caelius,
I cannot say that I am unconcerned about his past
behaviour: but still I am far less concerned. Then
there is another point. Pompey (and think of his
power and position) chose Q. Cassius without regard
to the lot, and Caesar too chose Antony. I could not
affront Caelius who had been given to me by lot, and
so make him a spy on the actions of my successor.
No; my present course is better, accords well with
precedent and is well suited to my time of life. But,</p>

<p class='c007'>Just as I had determined to write to you and had
taken up my pen, Batonius came straight from his
ship to my house at Ephesus and gave me your
letter on the 29th of September.  I am delighted
about your good voyage, and your opportune meeting
with your wife and also at her remarks about the
marriage of my daughter.  But Batonius brought
news that was simply awful about Caesar, and was
even more frank in conversation with Lepta.  I hope
his news is false: it was certainly terrifying.  He
says that Caesar will refuse to disband his army, that
the officials elect, praetors, Cassius the tribune and
Lentulus the consul take his part, and that Pompey
thinks of leaving Rome.</p>

<p class='c007'>But by the by, are you so sorry for the fellow that
thinks himself superior to the uncle of your sister’s
son? What fine opponents to beat him! But to
business.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Etesian winds have hindered me much: the
open Rhodian boats too caused me a delay of exactly
twenty days. On the 1st of October, as I am embarking
from Ephesus, I give this letter to L. Tarquitius,
who is leaving the harbour at the same time, but sailing
by a faster boat. I have had to wait for fair weather
owing to the undecked boats and other war vessels
of the Rhodians. However I am hurrying as fast as
possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as I landed in port on the 14th of Oct. I
received your letter from my slave Acastus. I have
been looking forward to it so long that I was surprised
at its brevity, as I looked at the letter before breaking
the seal. Again, when I opened it, I was startled at
the illegibility of the scribble, for your hand is
generally very fine and legible. In short I gathered
from the style of writing that you had arrived in town,
as you stated, on the 19th of Sept., suffering from an
attack of fever. Much disturbed, as I was bound to

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_481'>481</span>and you thought that it was nothing serious and that
he had gathered as much from your people. This
view seemed to be supported by a remark at the end
of your letter that at the time of writing you had a
touch of fever. However I was greatly surprised and
pleased at your writing to me in your own hand under
the circumstances. So I will say no more. For
I hope considering your careful and temperate life—and
to be sure Acastus bids me be confident—that
you are now as well as I could wish.</p>

<p class='c007'>I am glad you got my letter from Turranius. Keep
a very strict eye, as you love me, on the untimely
designs of that cooker of accounts Philotimus. As to
this legacy from Precius, which is a great sorrow to
me—for I loved him indeed—don’t let the fellow
lay a finger on it, small as it is. You will say that I
want money for the outfit of my triumph. You shall
see that following your advice I will not show foolish
vanity in seeking a triumph, nor be phlegmatic
enough to refuse it.</p>

<p class='c007'>I gather from your letter that you heard from
Turranius I had given over my province to my brother.
Do you imagine that I overlooked the cautious tone
of your letter? You wrote that you were doubtful.
There could have been no reason for doubts, if there
had been grounds for leaving a brother and such a
brother in charge. I took your doubts for dogmatic
rejection. You warn me on no account to leave the
young Quintus. Your words repeat my dream. The
same vision came to us both, as though we had talked
it over. There was nothing else to be done, and your
long doubt has relieved me of hesitation. But I
fancy you must have already got a letter on this
topic written in more detail.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
